    <!-- ===== OVERVIEW ===== -->
    <h1>Civil Procedure</h1>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>High-Yield Subject</h4>
      <p>Civil Procedure is tested on both the essay and MBE portions of the California Bar Exam. The CA exam blends federal civil procedure (FRCP) with California-specific procedural rules. You must know both systems and be ready to identify where they diverge.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Civil Procedure governs the mechanics of civil litigation&mdash;from filing a complaint through appeal. The subject encompasses <strong>jurisdiction</strong> (the court's power to hear a case), <strong>pleading and joinder</strong> (how claims and parties enter the lawsuit), <strong>discovery</strong> (how parties obtain information), <strong>trial</strong> (how disputes are resolved), and <strong>preclusion</strong> (when a judgment bars future litigation). On the CA Bar, you must master both the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) and California's Code of Civil Procedure (CCP).</p>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>California Distinction Alert</h4>
      <p>California essays often test <strong>both</strong> federal and state procedural rules in a single question. The typical prompt asks you to analyze whether a case can be brought in federal court, state court, or both&mdash;and what procedural rules apply in each forum. Always address California distinctions explicitly.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== I. SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION ===== -->
    <h2>I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction (SMJ)</h2>

    <p>Subject matter jurisdiction is the court's power to hear a particular <em>type</em> of case. Federal courts are courts of <strong>limited jurisdiction</strong>&mdash;they can only hear cases authorized by the Constitution and Congress. SMJ cannot be waived and can be raised at any time, even on appeal.</p>

    <h3>A. Federal Question Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. &sect; 1331)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; Well-Pleaded Complaint</h4>
      <p>Federal question jurisdiction exists when the plaintiff's <strong>well-pleaded complaint</strong> raises a claim "arising under" federal law. The federal issue must appear on the face of the plaintiff's complaint&mdash;not in an anticipated defense, counterclaim, or reply.</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule:</strong> Only the plaintiff's cause of action matters. A federal defense (even an inevitable one) does not create federal question jurisdiction. (<em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v. Mottley</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Federal Cause of Action:</strong> The claim must be <em>created by</em> federal law, or the claim must necessarily raise a <strong>substantial, disputed</strong> federal issue that a federal forum can entertain without disturbing the congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities. (<em>Grable &amp; Sons</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>No Amount-in-Controversy Requirement:</strong> Unlike diversity jurisdiction, federal question cases have no minimum dollar threshold.</li>
      <li><strong>Declaratory Judgment Actions:</strong> Look to the "nature of the underlying dispute"&mdash;the coercive action that could have been brought&mdash;to determine if federal question jurisdiction exists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Diversity Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. &sect; 1332)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; Complete Diversity</h4>
      <p>Diversity jurisdiction requires: (1) <strong>complete diversity</strong>&mdash;no plaintiff is a citizen of the same state as any defendant; and (2) the <strong>amount in controversy exceeds $75,000</strong>, exclusive of interest and costs.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Citizenship Rules</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Individuals:</strong> Domicile = physical presence + intent to remain indefinitely. Determined at time of filing.</li>
      <li><strong>Corporations:</strong> Dual citizenship&mdash;(a) state of incorporation AND (b) principal place of business (the "nerve center"&mdash;where high-level officers direct, control, and coordinate activities). (<em>Hertz Corp. v. Friend</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Unincorporated Associations (LLCs, partnerships):</strong> Citizenship of <em>every</em> member. An LLC with members in 10 states is a citizen of all 10.</li>
      <li><strong>Class Actions (CAFA):</strong> Under the Class Action Fairness Act (28 U.S.C. &sect; 1332(d)), only <strong>minimal diversity</strong> is required (any class member diverse from any defendant), AIC exceeds $5 million aggregate, and class has 100+ members.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Amount in Controversy (AIC)</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Standard:</strong> Must exceed $75,000. Plaintiff's good-faith allegation controls unless it appears to a "legal certainty" that the claim is really for less.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> A single plaintiff may aggregate all claims against a single defendant. Multiple plaintiffs cannot aggregate unless they share a <em>common undivided interest</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Injunctive Relief:</strong> Measured by either the value to the plaintiff or the cost to the defendant of complying.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Supplemental Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. &sect; 1367)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; Supplemental Jurisdiction</h4>
      <p>Federal courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are part of the <strong>same case or controversy</strong> (same "common nucleus of operative fact") as a claim within original federal jurisdiction. (<em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs</em>)</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>&sect; 1367(a):</strong> Grants supplemental jurisdiction over all claims sharing a common nucleus of operative fact with the anchor claim.</li>
      <li><strong>&sect; 1367(b) Limitation (diversity cases only):</strong> In cases founded <em>solely</em> on diversity, supplemental jurisdiction does NOT extend to claims by <strong>plaintiffs</strong> against persons made parties under Rules 14, 19, 20, or 24&mdash;when exercising jurisdiction would destroy complete diversity. (<em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah</em>&mdash;supplemental jurisdiction does allow additional plaintiffs who do not independently meet the AIC, as long as at least one plaintiff does.)</li>
      <li><strong>&sect; 1367(c) Discretionary Decline:</strong> Court may decline supplemental jurisdiction if: (1) novel/complex state law issue; (2) state claim substantially predominates; (3) all original-jurisdiction claims dismissed; (4) exceptional circumstances.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Removal (28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1441&ndash;1447)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; Removal</h4>
      <p>A <strong>defendant</strong> (never a plaintiff) may remove a case from state court to federal court if the case could have been filed originally in federal court. All defendants who have been served must join in or consent to removal within <strong>30 days</strong> of service.</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Forum Defendant Rule:</strong> A case cannot be removed on diversity grounds if <em>any</em> properly joined and served defendant is a citizen of the state where the action was filed.</li>
      <li><strong>One-Year Limit (Diversity):</strong> Diversity-based removal must occur within one year of commencement, unless the plaintiff acted in bad faith to prevent removal (e.g., joining a non-diverse defendant and then dropping them after one year).</li>
      <li><strong>Federal Question Removal:</strong> No forum-defendant rule and no one-year time limit.</li>
      <li><strong>Remand:</strong> If removal was improper, plaintiff moves to remand. Procedural defects must be raised within 30 days; lack of SMJ can be raised at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>CA Distinction &mdash; No Removal to California State Court</h4>
      <p>California has no removal procedure between state courts. A defendant cannot "remove" from one California court to another. Venue transfer within California courts is governed by CCP &sect;&sect; 394&ndash;399.5.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== II. PERSONAL JURISDICTION ===== -->
    <h2>II. Personal Jurisdiction (PJ)</h2>

    <p>Personal jurisdiction is the court's power over a particular <em>party</em>. Unlike SMJ, personal jurisdiction <strong>can be waived</strong> if not timely raised (Rule 12(h)(1)). The analysis requires: (1) a statutory basis (long-arm statute) and (2) constitutional due process (minimum contacts).</p>

    <h3>A. In Personam Jurisdiction</h3>

    <h4>1. General Jurisdiction</h4>
    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; General Jurisdiction</h4>
      <p>A court has general jurisdiction over a defendant who is "at home" in the forum. For individuals, this means domicile. For corporations, this means the state of incorporation and the principal place of business&mdash;and, in an "exceptional case," another forum. (<em>Daimler AG v. Bauman</em>)</p>
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Individuals:</strong> At home = domiciled in the forum state.</li>
      <li><strong>Corporations:</strong> At home = state of incorporation OR principal place of business. Mere "continuous and systematic" contacts are <em>not</em> enough after <em>Daimler</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Effect:</strong> General jurisdiction allows suit on <em>any</em> claim, even one unrelated to the forum.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Specific Jurisdiction</h4>
    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; Specific Jurisdiction (Three-Part Test)</h4>
      <p>Specific jurisdiction exists when: (1) the defendant has <strong>purposefully availed</strong> itself of the forum; (2) the claim <strong>arises out of or relates to</strong> those contacts; and (3) exercising jurisdiction is <strong>reasonable</strong> (fair play and substantial justice). (<em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</em>; <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz</em>)</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Purposeful Availment:</strong> The defendant must have deliberately reached into the forum, not merely had contacts caused by unilateral acts of a third party or the plaintiff. (<em>Hanson v. Denckla</em>; <em>World-Wide Volkswagen</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Stream of Commerce:</strong> Placing goods into the stream of commerce that reach the forum may suffice, but the Court is split:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Asahi</em> (O'Connor plurality): Requires "stream of commerce <strong>plus</strong>"&mdash;additional conduct indicating intent to serve the forum (advertising, designing for the market, establishing channels).</li>
          <li><em>Asahi</em> (Brennan plurality): Mere awareness that goods will reach the forum is sufficient.</li>
          <li><em>J. McIntyre Machinery v. Nicastro</em>: No majority rule, but the plurality endorsed the "plus" approach&mdash;targeting the U.S. market generally does not equal targeting any specific state.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Arises Out of / Relates To:</strong> After <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial District Court</em> (2021), the claim need not have a strict causal connection to the forum contacts. An "affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy" suffices&mdash;broadening the nexus requirement.</li>
      <li><strong>Reasonableness Factors</strong> (can defeat jurisdiction even if minimum contacts exist):
        <ul>
          <li>Burden on the defendant</li>
          <li>Forum state's interest in adjudicating</li>
          <li>Plaintiff's interest in convenient relief</li>
          <li>Interstate judicial system's interest in efficiency</li>
          <li>Shared interest of states in furthering substantive policies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Internet Jurisdiction</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Zippo Sliding Scale:</strong> (1) Passive websites (merely posting information) = no PJ; (2) interactive websites (exchanges of information) = depends on level of interactivity and commercial nature; (3) clearly doing business through the site = PJ likely.</li>
      <li><strong>Targeting Test (modern trend):</strong> Did the defendant target the forum through its online conduct? Consider whether the website specifically solicits forum residents, ships to the forum, or directs tortious conduct at forum residents. (<em>Calder v. Jones</em> "effects test" for intentional torts directed at forum.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. In Rem and Quasi In Rem Jurisdiction</h3>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Type</th><th>Definition</th><th>Due Process Requirement</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>In Rem</strong></td><td>Jurisdiction over a <em>thing</em> (property) located in the forum to determine all the world's rights in that property.</td><td>Must satisfy minimum contacts if defendant is nonresident. Notice must be reasonably calculated to inform interested parties. (<em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank</em>)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Quasi In Rem</strong></td><td>Jurisdiction based on defendant's property in the forum, but the dispute may be unrelated to that property. Judgment limited to the property's value.</td><td>After <em>Shaffer v. Heitner</em> (1977), quasi in rem jurisdiction must also satisfy <strong>minimum contacts</strong> analysis. Mere presence of property is insufficient.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>C. Consent and Other Bases</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> A party may consent to jurisdiction through a forum-selection clause, by filing suit, by making a general appearance, or by failing to object in a timely manner (waiver under Rule 12(h)(1)).</li>
      <li><strong>Voluntary Presence ("Tag" Jurisdiction):</strong> Personal service on an individual physically present in the forum state, even briefly, establishes PJ. (<em>Burnham v. Superior Court</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Domicile:</strong> A state always has PJ over its domiciliaries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Long-Arm Statutes</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>CA Distinction &mdash; California Long-Arm Statute (CCP &sect; 410.10)</h4>
      <p>California's long-arm statute extends to the <strong>full limits of due process</strong>: "A court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States." This means the statutory and constitutional analyses merge&mdash;if minimum contacts are satisfied, the long-arm statute is satisfied. Most federal long-arm statutes similarly extend to due process limits, but some states have more limited long-arm statutes requiring a separate statutory analysis.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== III. VENUE ===== -->
    <h2>III. Venue</h2>

    <h3>A. Proper Venue in Federal Court (28 U.S.C. &sect; 1391)</h3>
    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; Federal Venue</h4>
      <p>A civil action may be brought in: (1) a district where <strong>any defendant resides</strong>, if all defendants reside in the same state; (2) a district where a <strong>substantial part of the events or omissions</strong> giving rise to the claim occurred, or where a substantial part of the property at issue is located; or (3) if neither (1) nor (2) applies, any district where <strong>any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Residence:</strong> Individuals reside where domiciled. Corporations reside in any district where they are subject to personal jurisdiction. In multi-district states, a corporation resides in any district with sufficient contacts for PJ.</li>
      <li><strong>Venue is waivable:</strong> Improper venue must be raised by motion under Rule 12(b)(3) or it is waived.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Transfer of Venue</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>&sect; 1404(a) &mdash; Convenience Transfer:</strong> A court may transfer to any district where the case "might have been brought" or to which all parties consent, for convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice. <strong>Choice of law:</strong> Transferor court's choice-of-law rules apply. (<em>Van Dusen v. Barrack</em>; if plaintiff chose the forum, <em>Ferens v. John Deere</em>&mdash;transferor law still applies.)</li>
      <li><strong>&sect; 1406(a) &mdash; Cure of Improper Venue:</strong> If venue is improper, the court may dismiss or transfer in the interest of justice. After transfer, transferee court's choice-of-law rules apply.</li>
      <li><strong>&sect; 1407 &mdash; Multidistrict Litigation (MDL):</strong> The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation may transfer cases involving common questions of fact to a single district for coordinated pretrial proceedings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Forum Non Conveniens</h3>
    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; Forum Non Conveniens</h4>
      <p>A court may dismiss a case (it cannot transfer to a foreign country) when the balance of private and public interest factors <strong>strongly favors</strong> trial in an alternative, <strong>adequate</strong> forum (typically a foreign nation). Plaintiff's choice of forum receives deference, especially if the plaintiff is a U.S. citizen/resident. (<em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno</em>)</p>
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Private Factors:</strong> Access to proof, availability of compulsory process for witnesses, cost of attendance, practical problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Public Factors:</strong> Administrative burden, local interest, familiarity with applicable law, avoidance of conflicts-of-law problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== IV. ERIE DOCTRINE ===== -->
    <h2>IV. Erie Doctrine</h2>

    <p>When a federal court sits in diversity, it must decide whether to apply federal or state law on a given issue. The Erie doctrine resolves this tension.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule &mdash; Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938)</h4>
      <p>In diversity cases, federal courts apply <strong>state substantive law</strong> and <strong>federal procedural law</strong>. There is no federal general common law.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Erie Analysis Framework</h3>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Step-by-Step Erie Analysis (Click to Expand)</strong></summary>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Is there a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (or federal statute) directly on point?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Yes &rarr;</strong> Apply the <em>Hanna v. Plumer</em> (1965) analysis: The Federal Rule applies if it is <strong>valid</strong> under the Rules Enabling Act&mdash;i.e., it is "arguably procedural" and does not "abridge, enlarge, or modify" any substantive right. (Federal Rules are almost always upheld.)</li>
            <li><strong>No &rarr;</strong> Proceed to Step 2.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Is there a judge-made federal practice (not codified in FRCP)?</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Apply the <strong>modified outcome-determinative test</strong> with the <strong>twin aims of Erie</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li><em>Outcome Determinative</em> (<em>Guaranty Trust v. York</em>): Would applying the federal practice lead to a different outcome than applying the state rule?</li>
                <li><em>Balance of Interests</em> (<em>Byrd v. Blue Ridge</em>): Weigh the state interest in having its rule applied against any countervailing federal interest.</li>
                <li><em>Twin Aims</em> (<em>Hanna</em> refinement): Would ignoring the state rule lead to (a) <strong>forum shopping</strong> (litigants choosing federal court to get a different rule) or (b) <strong>inequitable administration of the law</strong> (similarly situated litigants getting different outcomes)?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If yes to forum shopping / inequitable administration &rarr; apply <strong>state law</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule 8(a) &mdash; Claim for Relief</h4>
      <p>A pleading must contain: (1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for jurisdiction; (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing the pleader is <strong>entitled to relief</strong>; and (3) a demand for the relief sought.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Twombly/Iqbal Plausibility Standard</h4>
      <p>A complaint must contain enough factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is <strong>plausible on its face</strong>. The court (1) identifies legal conclusions (not entitled to the assumption of truth) and (2) determines whether the remaining factual allegations plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief. (<em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly</em>; <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em>)</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">

    <h4>Relation Back (Rule 15(c))</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Rule 15(c) &mdash; Relation Back of Amendments</h4>
      <p>An amendment relates back to the original filing date when: (1) the law governing the applicable statute of limitations allows it; OR (2) the amendment asserts a claim or defense arising from the <strong>same conduct, transaction, or occurrence</strong> as the original pleading. For <strong>changing a party</strong>, the new party must have received notice within the Rule 4(m) service period (90 days) such that it will not be prejudiced, and it knew or should have known the action would have been brought against it but for a mistake of identity.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <h4>Common Pitfall</h4>
      <p>A "John Doe" pleading that later substitutes the real defendant does <strong>not</strong> relate back under the federal rule because the plaintiff's lack of knowledge of the defendant's identity is not a "mistake" concerning identity. (<em>Krupski v. Costa Crociere</em> clarified that the focus is on what the <em>new party</em> knew, not what the plaintiff knew.)</p>

          <li><strong>Offensive Nonmutual Collateral Estoppel:</strong> A new plaintiff uses a prior judgment against the defendant. Allowed at the court's discretion under <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore</em>, considering: (1) could the new plaintiff have easily joined the earlier action?

      <li><strong>Certified Interlocutory Appeals (&sect; 1292(b)):</strong> District court certifies and court of appeals agrees to hear an order involving a <strong>controlling question of law</strong> on which there is <strong>substantial ground for difference of opinion</strong>, and immediate appeal may <strong>materially advance</strong> the litigation's termination.</li>
      <li><strong>Collateral Order Doctrine:</strong> (<em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.</em>) An interlocutory order is immediately appealable if it: (1) conclusively determines a disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue <strong>completely separate</strong> from the merits; (3) is effectively <strong>unreviewable on appeal</strong> from a final judgment.

      <li>Extends to the <strong>full limits of constitutional due process</strong>.</li>
      <li>No need for separate statutory analysis&mdash;if minimum contacts are satisfied, the long-arm statute is satisfied.</li>
      <li>Contrast with states that have enumerated long-arm statutes (e.g., New York CPLR &sect; 302) where you must first find a statutory basis, then check due process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. California Pleading Standards</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>California uses <strong>fact pleading</strong> (CCP &sect; 425.10)&mdash;a complaint must state "the facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language." This is stricter than federal notice pleading under Rule 8.</li>
      <li>California does <strong>not</strong> follow <em>Twombly/Iqbal</em> plausibility pleading. However, the complaint must still allege ultimate facts (not conclusions of law or evidentiary facts).</li>
      <li><strong>Demurrer</strong> (CCP &sect; 430.10): California's equivalent of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint on its face. The court cannot consider extrinsic evidence (unlike Rule 12(d) conversion to SJ).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Cross-Complaints (CCP &sect; 428.10)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>CA Distinction &mdash; Cross-Complaints</h4>
      <p>California uses <strong>cross-complaints</strong> rather than the federal counterclaim/crossclaim framework. A cross-complaint is a separate pleading filed by the defendant against the plaintiff, a co-party, or even a new third party.</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Compulsory Cross-Complaint (CCP &sect; 426.30):</strong> A defendant must file a cross-complaint for any <strong>related cause of action</strong> against the plaintiff (arising from the same transaction or occurrence) existing at the time of the answer. Failure to do so <strong>bars</strong> the claim in a future action (similar to federal compulsory counterclaim).</li>
      <li><strong>Permissive Cross-Complaint (CCP &sect; 428.10):</strong> A party may file a cross-complaint against <em>any person</em> (even nonparties) asserting any cause of action, whether or not related. This is broader than federal impleader (Rule 14), which requires a derivative liability theory.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Difference:</strong> Under CCP &sect; 428.10, a cross-complaint can bring in entirely new parties on claims that are unrelated to the original action&mdash;far more permissive than the federal joinder rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>E. California Case Management and Other Distinctions</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Fast Track / Case Management (CRC Rule 3.714):</strong> California imposes statutory time limits for bringing cases to trial. Unlimited civil cases must generally be brought to trial within <strong>5 years</strong> of filing (CCP &sect; 583.310), or they are subject to mandatory dismissal.</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-SLAPP Statute (CCP &sect; 425.16):</strong> A defendant may bring a special motion to strike claims arising from acts in furtherance of the right of free speech or petition. The plaintiff must show a probability of prevailing on the merits.</li>
      <li><strong>Offer to Compromise (CCP &sect; 998):</strong> If a party rejects a settlement offer and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, cost-shifting penalties apply. Analogous to but distinct from FRCP Rule 68 (which only applies to offers by the defendant).</li>
      <li><strong>Jury Trial Right:</strong> California Constitution, Art. I, &sect; 16 guarantees jury trial in civil cases at law. Uses a similar historical analysis but with some broader statutory rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Preclusion in California:</strong> California generally follows the same claim and issue preclusion principles as federal law but adheres to the <strong>"primary rights" theory</strong> for claim preclusion&mdash;each invasion of a separate primary right gives rise to a separate cause of action. This can result in different claim preclusion outcomes than the federal transactional test.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== COMMON ESSAY PATTERNS ===== -->
    <h2>Common Essay Patterns</h2>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Pattern 1: Jurisdiction &amp; Venue Gauntlet</h4>
      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Multi-party dispute involving citizens of different states. One party files in federal court; another moves to dismiss or remove.<br>
      <strong>Issues:</strong> SMJ (diversity&mdash;check citizenship of each party, including LLCs; AIC; aggregation), personal jurisdiction (minimum contacts for out-of-state defendants; long-arm statute), venue (proper district; transfer motions), removal (timeliness; forum defendant rule; unanimity of defendants).<br>
      <strong>Approach:</strong> Systematically analyze SMJ, PJ, and venue for each party and each claim. Then address California state court as an alternative forum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Pattern 2: Erie Doctrine Application</h4>
      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Case in federal court on diversity; state and federal rules conflict on a specific procedural issue (e.g., statute of limitations, service method, burden of proof).<br>
      <strong>Issues:</strong> Is there a Federal Rule on point? If yes, apply <em>Hanna</em>. If no, apply the twin aims / outcome-determinative test.<br>
      <strong>Approach:</strong> Identify the conflict, classify the issue (substantive or procedural), and walk through the Erie framework step by step.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Pattern 3: Joinder and Supplemental Jurisdiction Maze</h4>
      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Multiple parties with interrelated claims. Questions about who can join, what claims can be brought, and whether SMJ exists for each.<br>
      <strong>Issues:</strong> Compulsory vs. permissive counterclaims, crossclaims, impleader, intervention, Rule 19/20 joinder. For each added claim/party: does &sect; 1367 provide supplemental jurisdiction, or is independent SMJ needed?<br>
      <strong>Approach:</strong> Map out every party and every claim. For each claim, determine the joinder rule, then separately analyze SMJ (including &sect; 1367(b) restrictions in diversity).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Pattern 4: Preclusion Analysis</h4>
      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Party litigated Case 1 and now brings Case 2 (or is being sued in Case 2). The opposing party argues preclusion bars the claim or issue.<br>
      <strong>Issues:</strong> Claim preclusion (same T/O? final judgment on the merits? same parties?), issue preclusion (actually litigated? essential to judgment? mutuality or nonmutual use?).<br>
      <strong>Approach:</strong> Analyze claim preclusion first, then issue preclusion. If California law applies, discuss the "primary rights" theory. Address nonmutual collateral estoppel if a stranger to Case 1 is involved.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Pattern 5: Discovery Disputes and Sanctions</h4>
      <p><strong>Setup:</strong> One party refuses to produce documents, asserts privilege or work product, or destroys evidence.<br>
      <strong>Issues:</strong> Scope of discovery (relevance, proportionality), attorney-client privilege (was the communication confidential? for legal advice?), work product (prepared in anticipation of litigation? ordinary vs. opinion?), waiver, spoliation sanctions under Rule 37(e).<br>
      <strong>Approach:</strong> Start with scope, then address specific privilege/protection claims, then analyze available sanctions.</p>

    <!-- ===== EXAM TIPS ===== -->
    <h2>Exam Tips</h2>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>1. Always Start with Jurisdiction</h4>
      <p>On any Civ Pro essay, address <strong>SMJ first, then PJ, then venue</strong>. If the court lacks jurisdiction, nothing else matters. State your conclusion on each before moving to the merits or procedural issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>2. Map Every Party and Claim</h4>
      <p>Before writing, sketch out every party and every claim between them. This prevents you from missing joinder issues, supplemental jurisdiction problems, or preclusion arguments. Label each claim with its joinder rule and SMJ basis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>3. Address California Explicitly</h4>
      <p>If the question mentions California or asks about "state court," you <strong>must</strong> discuss CA-specific rules (fact pleading, CCP &sect; 410.10 long-arm, cross-complaints, primary rights preclusion). Even if not explicitly asked, if the fact pattern involves a CA court, raise the CA distinction and compare to the federal rule.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>4. Erie Is Always Lurking in Diversity</h4>
      <p>Whenever a case is in federal court on diversity jurisdiction, ask: is there a potential conflict between state and federal rules? If so, apply the Erie framework. This is one of the most commonly tested crossover topics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>5. Supplemental Jurisdiction &mdash; Know &sect; 1367(b)</h4>
      <p>In diversity cases, always check whether a claim by a <strong>plaintiff</strong> against an added party falls within the &sect; 1367(b) restriction. Claims by <strong>defendants</strong> (counterclaims, crossclaims, impleader) are generally not restricted. This distinction is heavily tested.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>6. Preclusion &mdash; Two Separate Doctrines</h4>
      <p>Analyze claim preclusion and issue preclusion as <strong>separate questions</strong>. A claim may be precluded even if issue preclusion does not apply, and vice versa. Do not conflate them. When a nonparty seeks to use issue preclusion, discuss mutuality and the <em>Parklane Hosiery</em> factors.</p>
