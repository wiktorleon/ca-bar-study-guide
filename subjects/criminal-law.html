      <h1>Criminal Law</h1>
      <p class="subject-meta">Frequency: High | Last tested: July 2023</p>

      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>Criminal Law is one of the most frequently tested subjects on the California Bar Exam. It appears regularly on the essay portion and is a mainstay of the MBE. The bar examiners expect you to know both common-law rules and the Model Penal Code (MPC) approach, as well as important California statutory distinctions. Criminal Law essays almost always pair with Criminal Procedure, so be prepared to address both in a single essay.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>When a question says "under common law" or "at common law," apply traditional common-law rules. When it references the "Model Penal Code" or "modern view," apply MPC rules. On the California Bar essay, unless told otherwise, apply California law&mdash;but note the majority/common-law rule as well where relevant.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Key themes the examiners test repeatedly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Homicide distinctions (the bread and butter of Criminal Law essays)</li>
        <li>Inchoate crimes and accomplice liability</li>
        <li>Defenses&mdash;especially self-defense, intoxication, and insanity</li>
        <li>Theft crime distinctions</li>
        <li>California-specific rules on felony murder, diminished capacity, and provocative act murder</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="general-principles">I. General Principles</h2>

      <h3 id="actus-reus">A. Actus Reus (The Guilty Act)</h3>
      <p>Every crime requires a voluntary act or an omission where there is a legal duty to act.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Actus Reus</strong> requires a voluntary, conscious physical act by the defendant. Involuntary acts&mdash;such as reflexes, convulsions, movements during sleep or unconsciousness, or conduct under hypnosis&mdash;do not satisfy the actus reus requirement.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Voluntary Act</h4>
      <p>The act must be a product of the defendant's conscious will. The following are <strong>not</strong> voluntary acts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reflexes or convulsions</li>
        <li>Movements during unconsciousness or sleep (but note: if D knows he is prone to sleepwalking and fails to take precautions, liability may attach)</li>
        <li>Conduct during hypnosis</li>
        <li>An act that is not a product of the actor's determination (e.g., being physically forced by another person)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Under the MPC, only <strong>one</strong> voluntary act is required within the course of conduct. So if D voluntarily gets drunk and then injures someone while in an unconscious stupor, the voluntary act of drinking can satisfy the actus reus requirement.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Omissions (Failure to Act)</h4>
      <p>Generally, there is no duty to act. However, criminal liability for an omission arises when:</p>
      <div class="elements-list">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Statute imposes a duty</strong> (e.g., duty to file tax returns, duty to report child abuse)</li>
          <li><strong>Contract creates a duty</strong> (e.g., lifeguard, nurse, babysitter)</li>
          <li><strong>Special relationship</strong> (e.g., parent-child, spouse-spouse)</li>
          <li><strong>Voluntary assumption of care</strong> that isolates the victim from other sources of aid</li>
          <li><strong>Creation of the peril</strong> (defendant created the dangerous situation)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Watch Out</div>
        <p>Even where a duty to act exists, the defendant must have the <strong>ability</strong> to act. A parent who cannot swim has no duty to jump into deep water to save a drowning child (but may have a duty to call for help or throw a flotation device).</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Possession as an Act</h4>
      <p>Possession can satisfy the actus reus requirement if the defendant was aware of the possession and had sufficient time to terminate it. Possession can be actual (on the person) or constructive (within the person's dominion and control).</p>

      <h3 id="mens-rea">B. Mens Rea (The Guilty Mind)</h3>

      <h4>Common-Law Mens Rea</h4>
      <p>At common law, the mens rea terms were somewhat imprecise:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Specific intent:</strong> The defendant intended to achieve a particular result beyond the actus reus itself (e.g., larceny requires intent to permanently deprive; burglary requires intent to commit a felony therein; assault requires intent to commit a battery).</li>
        <li><strong>General intent:</strong> The defendant intended to do the proscribed act (e.g., battery, rape, kidnapping). Awareness of attending circumstances is sufficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Malice:</strong> The defendant acted with a reckless disregard of a known risk (e.g., arson, murder).</li>
        <li><strong>Strict liability:</strong> No mens rea required (e.g., statutory rape, selling liquor to minors, bigamy in some jurisdictions).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Specific intent crimes</strong> are significant because they allow additional defenses: voluntary intoxication and unreasonable mistake of fact can negate specific intent but NOT general intent.</p>

      <h4>Model Penal Code Mens Rea</h4>
      <p>The MPC replaces the common-law categories with four precisely defined levels of culpability, listed from most to least culpable:</p>

      <div class="elements-list">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Purposely (Intentionally):</strong> It is the defendant's conscious object to engage in the conduct or cause the result.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowingly:</strong> The defendant is aware that the conduct is of a particular nature or that a particular result is practically certain to occur.</li>
          <li><strong>Recklessly:</strong> The defendant consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk. The risk must be such that its disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct a law-abiding person would observe.</li>
          <li><strong>Negligently:</strong> The defendant should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. The risk must be such that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care a reasonable person would observe.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>The critical distinction between <strong>recklessly</strong> and <strong>negligently</strong> under the MPC: Recklessness requires <em>conscious</em> awareness of the risk (subjective), while negligence requires only that the defendant <em>should have been</em> aware (objective). This distinction is heavily tested.</p>
      </div>

      <table class="comparison-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>MPC Level</th>
            <th>Awareness of Risk</th>

      <h4>Transferred Intent</h4>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Transferred Intent:</strong> If the defendant intends to harm one person but accidentally harms another, the intent transfers from the intended victim to the actual victim. This applies to homicide, battery, and arson. It does <strong>not</strong> apply to attempt (the defendant can be charged with attempted murder of the intended victim AND murder of the actual victim).</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="concurrence">C. Concurrence</h3>
      <p>The mens rea must concur in time with the actus reus. The defendant must have the requisite mental state <strong>at the time</strong> of the criminal act.</p>
      <p>Example: D decides to kill V. The next day, D accidentally runs over V with a car. D is not guilty of murder because the intent to kill did not concur with the act that caused death.</p>

      <h3 id="causation">D. Causation</h3>
      <p>For result crimes (e.g., homicide), the prosecution must prove both actual and proximate causation.</p>

      <h4>Actual Cause (Cause-in-Fact)</h4>
      <p>Apply the "but-for" test: But for the defendant's act, the result would not have occurred when it did. For concurrent causes, use the "substantial factor" test: The defendant's act was a substantial factor in bringing about the result.</p>

      <h4>Proximate Cause (Legal Cause)</h4>
      <p>The result must be a natural and probable consequence of the defendant's conduct. The key issue is whether an intervening event breaks the causal chain.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Intervening causes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dependent intervening causes</strong> (responses to the defendant's act, such as medical treatment, victim's reactions) generally do <strong>not</strong> break the chain unless they are extraordinarily negligent or bizarre.</li>
          <li><strong>Independent intervening causes</strong> (coincidences unrelated to the defendant's act) <strong>do</strong> break the chain if they were unforeseeable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The defendant "takes the victim as he finds him" (eggshell-skull rule applies in criminal law too).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Watch Out</div>
        <p>Common intervening cause scenarios on the bar exam:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Negligent medical treatment:</strong> Generally does NOT break the chain (foreseeable).</li>
          <li><strong>Grossly negligent medical treatment:</strong> May break the chain (debatable; many courts still hold D liable).</li>
          <li><strong>Victim's refusal of medical treatment:</strong> Does NOT break the chain.</li>
          <li><strong>Victim's pre-existing condition that hastens death:</strong> Does NOT break the chain.</li>
          <li><strong>An unrelated third party who independently kills the victim:</strong> DOES break the chain (independent, unforeseeable).</li>
          <li><strong>Victim fleeing and injured in escape:</strong> Does NOT break the chain if the reaction was foreseeable.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>MPC Approach to Causation</h4>
      <p>Under the MPC, the result must not be "too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a just bearing on the actor's liability or on the gravity of his offense." For purposeful and knowing crimes, the result must not differ from the designed or contemplated result. For reckless and negligent crimes, the actual result must be within the risk of which the actor was (or should have been) aware.</p>

      <h2 id="homicide">II. Homicide</h2>

      <p>Homicide is the killing of a living human being by another human being. It is the single most frequently tested topic in Criminal Law. You must know the distinctions between the various grades and types.</p>

      <h3 id="murder-common-law">A. Murder at Common Law</h3>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Murder (Common Law):</strong> The unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. "Malice aforethought" can be established in four ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Intent to kill</strong> (express malice)</li>
          <li><strong>Intent to cause serious bodily harm</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Depraved-heart murder</strong> (reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life / "abandoned and malignant heart")</li>
          <li><strong>Felony murder</strong> (killing during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h3 id="first-degree-murder">B. First-Degree Murder</h3>
      <p>At common law, there were no degrees of murder. Statutory schemes divide murder into degrees. First-degree murder typically includes:</p>

      <div class="elements-list">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Premeditated and deliberate murder:</strong> The defendant made a conscious decision to kill after reflection, however brief. "Premeditated" means the defendant thought about the killing beforehand. "Deliberate" means the defendant made a conscious decision to kill in a cool and dispassionate manner.</li>
          <li><strong>Felony murder:</strong> A killing committed during the perpetration of certain enumerated felonies (typically BARRK: Burglary, Arson, Robbery, Rape, Kidnapping).</li>
          <li><strong>Murder by specified means:</strong> E.g., lying in wait, torture, poison, bombing, or use of weapons of mass destruction.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Premeditation does not require extensive planning. Courts have held that premeditation can be formed in an instant, "as quickly as successive thoughts of the mind." However, mere intent to kill, without more, is insufficient&mdash;there must be some evidence of reflection and deliberation. Look for facts suggesting: (1) planning activity, (2) motive, or (3) manner of killing suggesting preconceived design (the <em>Anderson</em> factors in California).</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="second-degree-murder">C. Second-Degree Murder</h3>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Second-Degree Murder</strong> is the "default" category of murder. It includes all murders with malice aforethought that do not qualify as first-degree murder:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Intent-to-kill murder without premeditation and deliberation</li>
          <li>Intent to inflict serious bodily harm murder</li>
          <li>Depraved-heart murder (extreme recklessness)</li>
          <li>Felony murder during a non-enumerated inherently dangerous felony</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4>Depraved-Heart Murder</h4>
      <p>Conduct that demonstrates a "depraved indifference to human life" or an "abandoned and malignant heart." The defendant acts with extreme recklessness, creating a very high risk of death. Examples: shooting into a crowded room, driving at extreme speeds through a busy intersection, playing Russian roulette.</p>

      <h3 id="felony-murder">D. Felony Murder</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Felony Murder Rule:</strong> Any killing (even an accidental one) committed during the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, a dangerous felony is murder. The malice element is supplied by the intent to commit the underlying felony. No additional mens rea for the killing itself is required.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Limitations on Felony Murder</h4>
      <div class="elements-list">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Inherently dangerous felony:</strong> The underlying felony must be inherently dangerous to human life (judged either in the abstract or as committed in the particular case, depending on the jurisdiction).</li>
          <li><strong>Merger doctrine (independent felony requirement):</strong> The underlying felony must be independent of the killing. Felonies that are <em>integral</em> to the homicide (e.g., assault, battery) "merge" with the killing and cannot serve as the predicate for felony murder. This prevents every manslaughter from being elevated to murder.</li>
          <li><strong>During the commission of the felony:</strong> The killing must occur during the commission, attempted commission, or immediate flight from the felony. The felony is complete when the felon has reached a place of temporary safety.</li>
          <li><strong>Causal connection:</strong> There must be a causal connection between the felony and the killing. The death must be a foreseeable result of the felony.</li>
          <li><strong>Co-felon liability:</strong> All co-felons are liable for felony murder committed by any co-felon during the felony.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Watch Out</div>
        <p><strong>The Agency Theory vs. Proximate Cause Theory:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Agency Theory (majority):</strong> Felony murder applies only to killings committed by the defendant or an agent (co-felon). If a bystander or police officer kills someone, the felons are NOT liable under felony murder.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximate Cause Theory (minority):</strong> Felony murder applies to any death that is a proximate result of the felony, including killings by third parties (e.g., police shooting a bystander).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p><strong>California Felony Murder (Post-SB 1437, effective 2019):</strong> California significantly narrowed the felony murder rule. A participant in a felony can only be liable for felony murder if the participant:</p>

          <li>Was a "major participant" in the underlying felony AND acted with "reckless indifference to human life" (the <em>Banks/Clark</em> factors).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This eliminated felony murder for minor participants in a felony who did not kill or intend to kill.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p><strong>Provocative Act Murder (California):</strong> When a defendant commits a provocative act (such as initiating a gun battle during a robbery) that causes a third party (such as a police officer or victim) to kill an innocent person or a co-felon, the surviving defendant can be charged with murder under an <em>implied malice</em> theory, not felony murder. This is sometimes called the "provocative act" doctrine.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="voluntary-manslaughter">E. Voluntary Manslaughter</h3>
      <p>Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing that is mitigated from murder due to extenuating circumstances. It is sometimes called a "heat of passion" killing.</p>

      <h4>1. Heat of Passion (Provocation)</h4>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Voluntary Manslaughter (Heat of Passion):</strong> A killing that would otherwise be murder is reduced to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant killed in the heat of passion after adequate provocation. The elements are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Adequate provocation:</strong> The provocation must be such that a reasonable person would have been provoked to lose self-control.</li>
          <li><strong>Actual heat of passion:</strong> The defendant must have actually been in a state of passion (anger, rage, fright) at the time of the killing.</li>
          <li><strong>No sufficient cooling time:</strong> There must not have been enough time for a reasonable person to cool off between the provocation and the killing.</li>
          <li><strong>Defendant did not actually cool off:</strong> The defendant must not have actually cooled off (even if a reasonable person would have).</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Traditionally adequate provocation includes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Being subjected to a serious battery or threat of deadly force</li>
        <li>Discovering a spouse in the act of adultery</li>
        <li>Witnessing an assault on a close family member</li>
        <li>Illegal arrest (in some jurisdictions)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>NOT adequate provocation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mere words alone (at common law; but the MPC and some modern courts allow words)</li>
        <li>Learning of adultery from a third party (as opposed to witnessing it)</li>
        <li>Trivial battery</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Under the <strong>MPC</strong>, the heat of passion doctrine is broadened to "extreme mental or emotional disturbance" (EMED) for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse. Under the MPC: (1) mere words CAN be sufficient; (2) the "cooling time" requirement is relaxed; and (3) the reasonableness of the explanation is determined from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation. This is a much more defendant-friendly standard.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>2. Imperfect Self-Defense</h4>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Imperfect Self-Defense:</strong> In some jurisdictions, including California, a killing is reduced from murder to voluntary manslaughter when the defendant had an honest but unreasonable belief that deadly force was necessary for self-defense. The defendant genuinely believed deadly force was needed but a reasonable person would not have.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p>California recognizes imperfect self-defense as a basis for reducing murder to voluntary manslaughter. This applies when the defendant had a genuine but unreasonable belief in the need for deadly force, or when the defendant used excessive force in response to a real threat. Note: imperfect self-defense is NOT available to the initial aggressor.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="involuntary-manslaughter">F. Involuntary Manslaughter</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Involuntary Manslaughter:</strong> An unintentional killing that results from:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Criminal negligence (gross negligence):</strong> The defendant's conduct involved a gross deviation from the standard of care a reasonable person would observe, creating a high risk of death or serious bodily harm. This is more than civil negligence but less than the extreme recklessness required for depraved-heart murder.</li>
          <li><strong>Misdemeanor manslaughter (unlawful-act doctrine):</strong> A killing committed during the commission of a misdemeanor or unenumerated felony that is not inherently dangerous.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Watch Out</div>
        <p>The distinction between <strong>depraved-heart murder</strong> and <strong>involuntary manslaughter</strong> (criminal negligence) is one of degree. Both involve risk creation. The difference: depraved-heart murder requires <em>extreme</em> recklessness (conscious disregard of an extremely high risk), while involuntary manslaughter requires only gross negligence or ordinary recklessness. On the exam, argue both when the facts are borderline.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Misdemeanor Manslaughter</h4>
      <p>A killing committed during a misdemeanor (or non-inherently-dangerous felony not qualifying for felony murder) is involuntary manslaughter. Limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some jurisdictions require the misdemeanor to be malum in se (inherently wrong) rather than malum prohibitum (wrong only because prohibited by statute)</li>
        <li>The death must be a foreseeable result of the unlawful act</li>
        <li>The defendant must have been committing the misdemeanor at the time of the killing</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Mens Rea of Attempt</h4>
      <p>Attempt is always a <strong>specific intent</strong> crime, regardless of the mens rea of the target offense. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attempted murder requires intent to kill (even though murder itself can be based on depraved-heart recklessness or felony murder)</li>
        <li>There is no such thing as "attempted felony murder" or "attempted depraved-heart murder"</li>
        <li>Voluntary intoxication can be a defense to attempt (because it is a specific intent crime)</li>

      <h4>Defenses to Attempt</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal impossibility:</strong> A valid defense. The defendant believes conduct is criminal when it is not (e.g., receiving goods believed to be stolen but actually not stolen).</li>
        <li><strong>Factual impossibility:</strong> NOT a defense. The defendant's intended crime was impossible due to circumstances unknown to the defendant (e.g., attempting to pick an empty pocket; shooting into an empty bed believing the victim is sleeping there).</li>
        <li><strong>Abandonment/Renunciation:</strong> At common law, abandonment is NOT a defense once a substantial step has been taken. Under the MPC, voluntary and complete renunciation IS a defense if the defendant abandoned the effort under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary change of heart (not because of increased risk of detection or postponement).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Merger</h4>
      <p>Attempt merges with the completed crime. If the defendant is convicted of the completed offense, the attempt conviction is vacated. However, a person can be charged with attempt if the completed crime cannot be proven.</p>

      <h3 id="solicitation">B. Solicitation</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Solicitation:</strong> Asking, encouraging, requesting, or commanding another person to commit a crime, with the intent that the crime be committed. The crime is complete at the moment of the asking&mdash;it does not matter whether the other person agrees or the crime is ever committed.</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mens rea:</strong> Specific intent that the other person commit the crime</li>
        <li><strong>Actus reus:</strong> The act of soliciting (asking, enticing, encouraging, commanding)</li>
        <li><strong>Merger:</strong> If the person solicited agrees, the crime of solicitation merges into conspiracy. If the crime is completed, solicitation merges into the completed crime.</li>
        <li><strong>Impossibility:</strong> Not a defense (e.g., soliciting an undercover officer)</li>
        <li><strong>Abandonment:</strong> At common law, NOT a defense (crime is complete upon asking). Under the MPC, renunciation IS a defense if voluntary and complete, AND the defendant thwarts the commission of the crime.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="conspiracy">C. Conspiracy</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Conspiracy:</strong> An agreement between two or more persons to commit an unlawful act, with the intent to achieve the objective of the agreement. At common law, no overt act is required. Most modern jurisdictions and the MPC require an <strong>overt act</strong> in furtherance of the conspiracy (even a minor preparatory act suffices).</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Elements</h4>
      <div class="elements-list">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Agreement:</strong> Between two or more persons. The agreement need not be express; it can be inferred from conduct. There is no requirement that all conspirators know each other or all details of the plan.</li>
          <li><strong>Intent to agree:</strong> The defendant must intentionally enter into the agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>Intent to achieve the objective:</strong> The defendant must have the specific intent to accomplish the unlawful objective.</li>
          <li><strong>Overt act</strong> (in most jurisdictions): Any act, even a minor preparatory one, performed by any conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h4>Key Conspiracy Issues</h4>

      <p><strong>No Merger:</strong> Unlike attempt and solicitation, conspiracy does NOT merge with the completed crime. A defendant can be convicted of both conspiracy and the target offense.</p>

      <p><strong>Bilateral vs. Unilateral Approach:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Common Law (Bilateral):</strong> Requires at least two "guilty minds." If one conspirator is an undercover agent, feigning agreement, there is no conspiracy because there is no true meeting of the minds.</li>
        <li><strong>MPC (Unilateral):</strong> Focuses on the defendant's individual culpability. A defendant can be guilty of conspiracy even if the other party is an undercover agent or is feigning agreement. Only one "guilty mind" is required.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p>California follows the <strong>bilateral</strong> (traditional) approach. Both parties must genuinely agree. Also, California requires an <strong>overt act</strong> for all conspiracies except those involving the most serious felonies.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Pinkerton Doctrine (Co-Conspirator Liability):</strong></p>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Pinkerton Doctrine:</strong> Each conspirator is liable for all crimes committed by co-conspirators that are (1) in furtherance of the conspiracy and (2) were <strong>foreseeable</strong> consequences of the conspiratorial agreement. This is vicarious liability&mdash;the defendant need not have participated in, known of, or agreed to the specific crime.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Watch Out</div>
        <p>The MPC rejects the Pinkerton doctrine. Under the MPC, a conspirator is only liable for the crimes of co-conspirators if the conspirator qualifies as an accomplice to those crimes.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Wharton's Rule:</strong></p>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Wharton's Rule:</strong> Where a crime by definition requires two participants (e.g., adultery, dueling, bribery, bigamy), there can be no conspiracy conviction if only the minimum number of participants are involved. However, if a <em>third</em> party participates, conspiracy charges are possible. Note: Wharton's Rule is a judicial presumption, not a constitutional bar, and can be overcome by legislative intent.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Withdrawal from Conspiracy:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>At common law, withdrawal does NOT relieve a defendant of liability for the conspiracy itself (because the crime is complete upon agreement), but it CAN terminate liability for future crimes committed by co-conspirators.</li>
        <li>To effectively withdraw, the defendant must: (1) give timely notice of withdrawal to all co-conspirators, OR (2) inform law enforcement.</li>
        <li>Under the MPC, withdrawal can be a defense to the conspiracy itself if the defendant "thwarts the success of the conspiracy."</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Conspiracy Structures</h4>
      <p><strong>Chain conspiracy:</strong> A single conspiracy where each participant performs a role in a chain of distribution (e.g., drug manufacturing &rarr; distribution &rarr; street sales). Each link is liable for the acts of all other links.</p>
      <p><strong>Wheel conspiracy:</strong> A central figure (hub) has separate agreements with multiple parties (spokes). Whether this is one conspiracy or multiple conspiracies depends on whether the spokes knew of each other and had a "community of interest."</p>

        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>Modern law and the MPC have largely abolished these distinctions. Today, all parties except accessories after the fact are treated as "principals" and are equally liable. An accessory after the fact is guilty of a separate, lesser offense (obstruction of justice or harboring a fugitive).</p>
      </div>

      <h3>B. Modern Accomplice Liability</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Accomplice Liability:</strong> A person is liable as an accomplice if, with the <strong>intent to assist</strong> the principal and the <strong>intent that the crime be committed</strong>, the person <strong>aids, abets, encourages, or assists</strong> the principal in committing the crime. An accomplice is liable for the target crime AND all other crimes that are the <strong>natural and probable consequences</strong> of the crime aided (in most jurisdictions).</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Actus Reus of Accomplice Liability</h4>
      <p>The accomplice must provide some aid, encouragement, or assistance. This can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing weapons, tools, or information</li>
        <li>Serving as a lookout or getaway driver</li>
        <li>Encouraging or counseling the principal</li>
        <li>Failing to act where there is a duty to prevent the crime (e.g., a police officer who stands by)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mere presence at the scene, even with knowledge, is generally insufficient (but presence plus some encouragement may suffice).</p>

      <h4>Mens Rea of Accomplice Liability</h4>
      <p>The accomplice must have a dual intent:</p>
      <div class="elements-list">
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Intent to assist</strong> the principal in the conduct that constitutes the offense</li>
          <li><strong>Intent that the principal commit</strong> the underlying offense (the mental state required for the crime)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Watch Out</div>
        <p><strong>Natural and Probable Consequences Doctrine:</strong> An accomplice is liable not only for the intended crime but also for any other crimes committed by the principal that were a natural and probable consequence of the crime encouraged or facilitated. Example: If D encourages P to rob a store, and P kills the store clerk, D may be liable for the murder as a natural and probable consequence of the robbery.</p>
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The MPC rejects this doctrine; accomplice liability under the MPC requires purpose with respect to the specific crime.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p>In <em>People v. Chiu</em> (2014), the California Supreme Court held that the natural and probable consequences doctrine <strong>cannot</strong> support a conviction for first-degree premeditated murder. An aider and abettor can only be convicted of first-degree premeditated murder based on direct aiding and abetting principles (i.e., with intent to kill or knowledge that the principal intended to kill). SB 1437 further limited accomplice liability for murder, requiring that the accomplice either: (1) was the actual killer, (2) acted with intent to kill, or (3) was a major participant who acted with reckless indifference to human life.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Withdrawal</h4>
      <p>An accomplice can avoid liability by withdrawing before the crime is committed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If aid was <strong>encouragement</strong>: The accomplice must repudiate the encouragement and communicate this to the principal.</li>
        <li>If aid was <strong>material assistance</strong>: The accomplice must neutralize the assistance (e.g., retrieve the weapon provided) OR notify law enforcement.</li>
        <li>Withdrawal must occur before the crime becomes unstoppable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Scope of Liability</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>An accomplice can be convicted even if the principal is acquitted, not charged, or not identified.</li>
        <li>An accomplice cannot be convicted of a higher crime than the principal actually committed.</li>
        <li>Protected persons (e.g., a statutory rape victim) cannot be accomplices to the crime designed to protect them.</li>
      </ul>

        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Battery:</strong> The unlawful application of force to another person, resulting in bodily harm or an offensive touching. Battery is a <strong>general intent</strong> crime&mdash;the defendant need only intend to do the act that results in the harmful or offensive contact.</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li>Direct or indirect contact (e.g., throwing an object, setting a trap, poisoning food)</li>

      <h3>B. Assault</h3>

      <p>Assault can be defined in two ways:</p>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Assault (Attempted Battery):</strong> An attempt to commit a battery&mdash;an intentional act that comes close to inflicting bodily harm on another. This is a <strong>specific intent</strong> crime (intent to commit the battery).</p>
        <p><strong>Assault (Threat / Apprehension):</strong> An intentional creation of a reasonable apprehension of imminent bodily harm in the victim's mind. This is a <strong>general intent</strong> crime. The victim must be aware of the threat.</p>

        <div class="callout-title">Watch Out</div>
        <p>Words alone are generally insufficient for assault&mdash;there must be some overt act or gesture. Also, the victim must have a reasonable apprehension of <strong>imminent</strong> harm.

        <p><strong>False Imprisonment:</strong> The unlawful confinement of a person without consent. It is a <strong>general intent</strong> crime. The confinement must be total&mdash;blocking one exit is insufficient if the victim can leave through another reasonable exit.</p>

      <h3>B. Kidnapping</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Kidnapping:</strong> The unlawful confinement of a person that involves either (1) moving the victim (asportation) or (2) concealing the victim in a secret place. At common law, the movement had to be substantial. Modern statutes vary in the amount of movement required.</p>
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aggravated kidnapping:</strong> Kidnapping for ransom, kidnapping for sexual purposes, kidnapping of a child, or kidnapping that results in bodily harm.</li>
        <li><strong>The asportation element:</strong> Movement must be more than incidental to another crime (e.g., moving a robbery victim from one room to another may not be sufficient).</li>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p>California Penal Code &sect;207 defines kidnapping as moving another person a substantial distance by force or fear. "Substantial distance" is evaluated based on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the movement: (1) increased the risk of harm, (2) decreased the likelihood of detection, or (3) was more than merely incidental to the commission of another crime. Aggravated kidnapping (PC &sect;209) includes kidnapping for ransom, reward, or extortion and carries a life sentence.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Statutory Rape:</strong> Sexual intercourse with a person under the age of consent. This is a <strong>strict liability</strong> crime&mdash;the defendant's mistake as to the victim's age is NOT a defense (in most jurisdictions). Consent is irrelevant.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reasonable belief:</strong> The defendant reasonably believed that force was necessary to defend against an imminent threat of unlawful bodily harm.</li>
          <li><strong>Proportional force:</strong> The force used must be proportional to the threat. Deadly force may only be used to defend against a threat of death or serious bodily harm.</li>
          <li><strong>Imminence:</strong> The threat must be imminent&mdash;not past, not future.</li>
          <li><strong>Not the initial aggressor:</strong> The defendant must not have been the initial aggressor, unless the defendant withdrew from the encounter and communicated the withdrawal.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h4>Deadly Force</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>May only be used when the defendant reasonably believes that deadly force or serious bodily harm is imminent</li>

      <h4>Retreat Doctrine</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Majority/Common Law:</strong> There is NO duty to retreat before using force, including deadly force.</li>
        <li><strong>Minority/Some states:</strong> A duty to retreat before using deadly force, if retreat can be accomplished safely. Exception: No duty to retreat from one's own home ("Castle Doctrine").</li>
        <li><strong>MPC:</strong> Duty to retreat before using deadly force if retreat can be accomplished with complete safety, but no duty to retreat from one's dwelling or workplace.</li>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p>California follows the <strong>no-retreat</strong> rule. A person has no duty to retreat before using force, including deadly force, in self-defense. Additionally, California's Castle Doctrine (Penal Code &sect;198.5) creates a presumption that a person who uses deadly force against an intruder in their home held a reasonable fear of imminent death or great bodily injury.</p>

      <h4>Initial Aggressor</h4>
      <p>An initial aggressor generally cannot claim self-defense unless:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The aggressor withdraws from the encounter <strong>and</strong> communicates the withdrawal, OR</li>
        <li>The victim responds with excessive or disproportionate force (escalating from non-deadly to deadly force)</li>

        <p><strong>Defense of Others:</strong> A person may use reasonable force to defend a third party if the defendant reasonably believes that the third party has the right to use self-defense. The majority/modern view: the defender is judged based on how the situation <strong>reasonably appeared</strong> to the defender (not whether the third party actually had the right of self-defense). The minority/older rule: the defender "stands in the shoes" of the person defended and can only use force if that person was actually entitled to self-defense.</p>

      <h3 id="defense-of-property">C. Defense of Property</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Defense of Property:</strong> A person may use reasonable <strong>non-deadly</strong> force to prevent the unlawful taking of or damage to property. <strong>Deadly force may NEVER be used solely to defend property.</strong> The defendant must first request that the interference stop (unless the request would be futile or dangerous).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Watch Out</div>
        <p><strong>Spring guns and booby traps:</strong> A property owner may NOT use mechanical devices (spring guns, booby traps) that use deadly force to protect property.

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Necessity:</strong> The defendant reasonably believed that the criminal conduct was necessary to prevent a greater harm. Elements:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The defendant faced a choice of evils (harm from nature, not from a human threat&mdash;that's duress)</li>
          <li>The defendant chose the lesser evil</li>
          <li>There was no reasonable legal alternative</li>
          <li>The harm avoided was greater than the harm caused</li>
          <li>The defendant did NOT create the danger</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Necessity is generally NOT a defense to intentional homicide. Under the MPC, necessity (choice of evils) IS potentially a defense to any crime if the harm avoided is clearly greater.</p>

          <li>A threat of imminent death or serious bodily harm</li>
          <li>The threat was from another person (not nature&mdash;that's necessity)</li>
          <li>A reasonable person in the defendant's situation would have committed the crime</li>
          <li>The defendant was not at fault in creating the situation</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Duress is NOT a defense to intentional homicide (murder)</strong> at common law. The MPC allows duress as a defense to all crimes, including homicide, if a person of reasonable firmness would have been unable to resist.</p>

        <p><strong>Voluntary Intoxication:</strong> A defense ONLY to <strong>specific intent</strong> crimes, where the intoxication prevented the defendant from forming the required specific intent. It is NOT a defense to general intent, malice, or strict liability crimes. Under the MPC, voluntary intoxication negates purpose or knowledge but not recklessness or negligence.</p>

        <p>California Penal Code &sect;29.4 provides that voluntary intoxication is admissible solely on the issue of whether the defendant actually formed a required <strong>specific intent</strong> or, when charged with murder, whether the defendant premeditated, deliberated, or harbored express malice aforethought. Voluntary intoxication is NOT a defense to implied malice (depraved-heart) murder.</p>

      <h3 id="insanity">G. Insanity</h3>

      <p>Insanity is a defense that, if successful, results in a verdict of "not guilty by reason of insanity" (NGRI). The defendant bears the burden of proving insanity (by a preponderance of the evidence in most jurisdictions). There are four major tests:</p>

        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p>California uses the <strong>M'Naghten test</strong> for insanity. Under California law, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time of the offense, the defendant was incapable of (1) knowing the nature and quality of the act, OR (2) distinguishing right from wrong. The irresistible impulse test is NOT used in California.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="diminished-capacity">H. Diminished Capacity</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Diminished Capacity:</strong> Evidence of a mental condition short of insanity that negates the specific intent required for the crime. If successful, the defendant is convicted of a lesser offense (e.g., second-degree murder instead of first-degree murder).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p><strong>California has ABOLISHED the diminished capacity defense.</strong> After the Dan White ("Twinkie Defense") case, California enacted Penal Code &sect;28(b), which eliminates diminished capacity as a defense. However, California does allow evidence of mental illness to show that the defendant did not actually form the required specific intent, premeditation, or deliberation ("diminished actuality"). This is a subtle but important distinction&mdash;the evidence goes to whether the defendant <em>actually formed</em> the mens rea, not whether the defendant had the <em>capacity</em> to form it.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="infancy">I. Infancy</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Infancy Defense (Common Law):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Under 7:</strong> Conclusive presumption of incapacity&mdash;cannot be convicted of any crime.</li>
          <li><strong>Ages 7-13:</strong> Rebuttable presumption of incapacity. The prosecution can rebut by showing the child understood the wrongfulness of the act.</li>
          <li><strong>14 and older:</strong> Treated as adults (no presumption of incapacity).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 id="entrapment">J. Entrapment</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Entrapment:</strong> A defense when the government induces the defendant to commit a crime that the defendant was not predisposed to commit. Two tests:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Subjective test (majority):</strong> Focuses on the defendant's predisposition. If the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime, entrapment fails&mdash;even if the government provided the opportunity. The jury decides.</li>
          <li><strong>Objective test (MPC/minority):</strong> Focuses on the government's conduct. Was the government's conduct likely to induce a law-abiding person to commit the crime? The judge decides.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p>California uses the <strong>objective test</strong> for entrapment. The question is whether the police conduct was likely to induce a normally law-abiding person to commit the crime. The defendant's predisposition is irrelevant.</p>

      <h4>Mistake of Fact</h4>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Mistake of Fact:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Specific intent crimes:</strong> ANY honest mistake of fact (reasonable or unreasonable) is a defense if it negates the specific intent.</li>
          <li><strong>General intent crimes:</strong> Only a <strong>reasonable</strong> mistake of fact is a defense.</li>
          <li><strong>Strict liability crimes:</strong> Mistake of fact is NEVER a defense.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Under the MPC: A mistake of fact is a defense if it negates the mens rea required for the offense.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Mistake of Law</h4>
      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule</div>
        <p><strong>Mistake of Law:</strong> Generally NOT a defense ("ignorance of the law is no excuse"). Exceptions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The statute was not published or made available</li>
          <li>Reasonable reliance on an official interpretation of the law (e.g., a statute, judicial decision, or official government statement later determined to be erroneous)</li>
          <li>The statute requires knowledge of the law as an element of the offense</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: Reliance on advice of a private attorney is NOT a valid mistake-of-law defense.</p>

      <h2 id="exam-tips">XV. Exam Writing Tips</h2>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
        <p><strong>Always analyze the homicide ladder from top to bottom.</strong> Start with first-degree murder and work down. Even if the defendant is clearly guilty of a lesser offense, you should explain why the higher charges do or do not apply. This demonstrates thoroughness and earns maximum points.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>IRAC Structure for Criminal Law</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Issue:</strong> Identify the crime and the specific legal question (e.g., "The issue is whether D is guilty of first-degree murder based on premeditation and deliberation.")</li>
        <li><strong>Rule:</strong> State the complete rule with all elements. Be precise. Include the mens rea, actus reus, and any special requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Apply EACH element to the facts. This is where you earn the most points. Use specific facts from the question. Argue both sides when the facts are ambiguous.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> State your conclusion. On the bar, a reasonable conclusion either way is acceptable&mdash;what matters is the analysis.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Subject-Specific Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Address every defendant separately.</strong> If there are multiple defendants, analyze each one's liability independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Always discuss defenses.</strong> Even if the facts seem straightforward, look for applicable defenses. The examiners put defense triggers in the fact pattern for a reason.</li>
        <li><strong>Distinguish specific and general intent.</strong> This distinction drives the analysis for intoxication and mistake defenses.</li>
        <li><strong>For theft crimes, focus on what the victim gave up.</strong> Did the victim give up nothing (larceny), possession (larceny by trick), or title (false pretenses)? Did the defendant already have possession (embezzlement)?</li>
        <li><strong>For conspiracy, always check Pinkerton.</strong> If co-conspirators commit additional crimes, discuss whether each conspirator is liable under Pinkerton.</li>
        <li><strong>Note California distinctions explicitly.</strong> When a California rule differs from the common-law rule, state both rules and apply California law. Use phrases like "Under California law, unlike the common-law rule..."</li>
        <li><strong>For felony murder, discuss all limitations.</strong> Don't just state the rule&mdash;analyze the merger doctrine, the inherently dangerous felony requirement, the agency/proximate cause theories, and the during-the-felony timing requirement.</li>
      </ul>
