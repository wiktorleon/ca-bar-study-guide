    <!-- ===== OVERVIEW ===== -->
    <h1>Community Property</h1>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>California-Specific Subject</h4>
      <p>Community Property is <strong>exclusively tested under California law</strong> on the CA Bar Exam. There is no federal or "majority rule" counterpart. Every rule in this outline derives from the California Family Code, California Probate Code, or California case law. This subject appears regularly on essay exams and frequently crosses over with Wills &amp; Succession, Professional Responsibility (fiduciary duty between spouses), and Remedies.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>I. Overview</h2>

    <p>California is one of nine community property states. The foundational principle is that <strong>marriage is an economic partnership</strong>: property acquired during marriage through the labor, skill, or effort of either spouse belongs equally to both. Community property law governs the characterization, management, and division of marital property&mdash;both during the marriage and upon its termination by divorce or death.</p>

    <h3>A. The General Community Property Presumption</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 760</h4>
      <p>Except as otherwise provided by statute, <strong>all property, real or personal, wherever situated, acquired by a married person during the marriage while domiciled in California is community property</strong>. This is a rebuttable presumption; the party claiming SP status bears the burden of proof.</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Property is characterized at the <em>time of acquisition</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Source of funds:</strong> If acquired with CP funds, it is CP; if acquired with SP funds, it is SP (tracing).</li>
      <li><strong>Burden of proof:</strong> The spouse claiming property is SP must prove it by a <em>preponderance of the evidence</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Characterization is fixed:</strong> Once characterized, property generally retains that character unless transmuted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Separate Property Defined</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 770</h4>
      <p>Separate property of a married person includes: (1) all property owned before marriage; (2) all property acquired during marriage by <strong>gift, bequest, devise, or descent</strong>; and (3) the rents, issues, and profits of separate property.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Key Distinction: California vs. Other CP States</h4>
      <p>In California, <strong>rents, issues, and profits of SP remain SP</strong>. This differs from some other community property jurisdictions (e.g., Texas, Idaho, Louisiana) where income from SP may be CP. This is a frequently tested distinction.</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Pre-marriage property:</strong> Anything owned before the date of marriage.</li>
      <li><strong>Gifts and inheritance:</strong> Property received by gift, bequest, devise, or descent&mdash;even during marriage&mdash;is SP of the recipient spouse.</li>
      <li><strong>After separation:</strong> Earnings and accumulations after the <em>date of separation</em> are SP. (Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 771.)</li>
      <li><strong>Rents, issues, and profits of SP:</strong> Income generated by SP assets (e.g., rent from a pre-marriage rental property) remains SP.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Date of Separation</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 70 (Post-2017 Amendment)</h4>
      <p>"Date of separation" means the date that a <strong>complete and final break in the marital relationship</strong> has occurred, as evidenced by both: (1) the spouse's <strong>expressed intent</strong> to end the marriage, and (2) <strong>conduct consistent</strong> with that intent. This codified and clarified the <em>In re Marriage of Davis</em> (2015) standard, superseding the earlier physical separation requirement of <em>In re Marriage of Norviel</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== CORE RULES ===== -->
    <h2>II. Core Rules: Characterization</h2>

    <h3>A. Time-of-Acquisition Rule</h3>
    <p>The character of property is determined at the <strong>moment of acquisition</strong>. The form of title does not conclusively determine characterization (though it creates presumptions in certain contexts). Key principles:</p>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Property purchased during marriage with earnings is CP, regardless of which spouse earned the money or whose name is on the title.</li>
      <li>Property acquired before marriage is SP, even if used during the marriage or improved with CP funds (though CP may gain a reimbursement right).</li>
      <li>Property acquired by <strong>installment purchase</strong> beginning before marriage: characterized based on the <em>inception of title</em> or <em>pro rata</em> approach, depending on the asset type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Source-of-Funds (Tracing)</h3>
    <p>When CP and SP funds are commingled, the character of an asset purchased from a commingled account must be traced to its source. California recognizes two primary tracing methods:</p>

    <h4>1. Direct Tracing</h4>
    <p>The proponent shows that the <strong>specific funds used to acquire the asset</strong> were SP. The spouse must demonstrate an intent to use SP funds for the purchase, even though CP funds were also available in the account.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>Direct Tracing Requirements</h4>
      <p>The SP proponent must show: (1) adequate SP funds existed in the commingled account at the time of purchase, and (2) the spouse <strong>intended</strong> to use SP funds. This method is unavailable if the SP proponent cannot identify the SP funds at the time of acquisition.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>2. Exhaustion Method (Family Expense Presumption)</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>In re Marriage of Mix (1975)</h4>
      <p>Under the exhaustion (or "recapitulation") method, the community is presumed to spend <strong>community funds first</strong> on family expenses. Whatever remains in a commingled account after family expenses are deducted is SP. If CP funds have been exhausted, any remaining balance is SP.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <h4>Tracing Failure</h4>
      <p>If neither tracing method can adequately identify the character of funds, the <strong>general CP presumption controls</strong> and the property is characterized as CP. The burden is always on the SP proponent.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>C. Commingling</h3>
    <p>Commingling alone does <strong>not</strong> transmute SP into CP. But if SP and CP are so mixed that the SP component can no longer be traced, the SP is deemed "lost" and the entire fund is treated as CP.</p>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Bank accounts:</strong> Depositing SP into a joint account does not automatically convert it to CP, but the depositing spouse bears the burden of tracing.</li>
      <li><strong>Improvements:</strong> Using CP funds to improve SP real estate gives the community a right of reimbursement or a pro rata interest (see <em>In re Marriage of Moore/Marsden</em>, below).</li>
      <li><strong>Business income:</strong> If a spouse operates an SP business using community labor, the community has a right to compensation (see Pereira/Van Camp, below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Quasi-Community Property</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 125</h4>
      <p><strong>Quasi-community property (QCP)</strong> is property acquired by either spouse while domiciled <em>outside</em> California that <strong>would have been CP if the acquiring spouse had been domiciled in California</strong> at the time of acquisition. QCP is relevant only upon <strong>divorce</strong> or <strong>death</strong> of the acquiring spouse.</p>
    </div>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Event</th><th>Treatment of QCP</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Divorce</strong></td><td>QCP is divided equally, just like CP. (Fam. Code &sect; 2550.)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Death of acquiring spouse</strong></td><td>Surviving spouse gets 1/2 of QCP; decedent can dispose of only their 1/2. (Prob. Code &sect; 101.)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Death of non-acquiring spouse</strong></td><td>QCP is <em>not</em> recognized; it remains the acquiring spouse's separate property. The non-acquiring spouse's estate has no claim.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>During marriage</strong></td><td>QCP has no effect during the ongoing marriage; it is treated as the acquiring spouse's property under the law of the state where acquired.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Migration Hypo</h4>
      <p>A classic exam pattern: Couple lives in a common-law state (e.g., New York), where Husband earns a salary and buys stock in his name alone. They then move to California. The stock is <strong>QCP</strong>&mdash;it would have been CP had they lived in California when acquired. At divorce, the court divides it equally. At Husband's death, Wife gets her 1/2. But if Wife dies first, Husband keeps it all.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== TRANSMUTATION ===== -->
    <h3>E. Transmutation</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 850&ndash;853</h4>
      <p>A <strong>transmutation</strong> is a change in the character of property from SP to CP, CP to SP, or one spouse's SP to the other spouse's SP. California's transmutation rules changed dramatically in 1985.</p>
    </div>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Period</th><th>Requirement</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Before January 1, 1985</strong></td><td>Transmutation could be oral, implied by conduct, or through an agreement. Mutual understanding or oral consent was sufficient.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>On or after January 1, 1985</strong></td><td>A transmutation is <strong>not valid</strong> unless made in writing by an <strong>express declaration</strong> that is made, joined in, consented to, or accepted by the spouse whose interest is adversely affected. (Fam. Code &sect; 852(a).)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <h4>The "Express Declaration" Requirement</h4>
      <p>Under <em>In re Marriage of Benson</em> (2005), the writing must contain an <strong>express declaration</strong> that the character of the property is being changed. A mere change in title (e.g., adding a spouse's name to a deed) does <em>not</em> satisfy the requirement. The document need not use the word "transmutation," but it must clearly indicate a change in ownership character.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Gift Exception</h4>
    <p>The writing requirement does <strong>not</strong> apply to a gift of <strong>tangible personal property of a personal nature</strong> (e.g., jewelry, clothing, personal items) that is <em>not substantial in value</em> taking into account the circumstances of the marriage. (Fam. Code &sect; 852(c).)</p>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <h4>Exam Trap: Gifts of Substantial Value</h4>
      <p>A gift of an expensive item (e.g., a $50,000 watch) likely does <em>not</em> fall within the gift exception if it is "substantial in value" given the parties' circumstances. Also, the exception applies only to <strong>tangible personal property</strong>&mdash;not real estate, not bank accounts, not stocks.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== JOINT TITLE PRESUMPTIONS ===== -->
    <h3>F. Joint Title Presumptions</h3>

    <h4>1. General CP Presumption (Fam. Code &sect; 2581)</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>At Divorce: &sect; 2581 Presumption</h4>
      <p>For <strong>division at divorce</strong>, property acquired during marriage in <strong>joint form</strong> (joint tenancy, tenancy in common, "community property," or as "community property with right of survivorship") is <em>presumed</em> CP for purposes of division, regardless of the source of funds. This presumption can only be rebutted by a <strong>clear statement in a deed or other written document</strong> that the property is SP, or by proof that the parties had a <strong>written agreement</strong> that the property was SP.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>2. The Lucas Rule and Anti-Lucas Legislation</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>In re Marriage of Lucas (1980) and Legislative Response</h4>
      <p><strong>Lucas:</strong> When one spouse used SP funds to acquire property taken in joint title, the SP-contributing spouse was entitled only to a <strong>1/2 interest</strong> (not reimbursement of SP contribution) because the joint title was treated as a "gift" of the SP to the community.</p>
      <p><strong>Anti-Lucas legislation (Fam. Code &sect; 2640):</strong> The legislature reversed Lucas. Now, a party who contributes SP to the acquisition of jointly-titled property is entitled to <strong>reimbursement of their SP contribution</strong> (without interest or appreciation) before the remaining value is divided equally as CP. The contributing spouse must <strong>trace</strong> their SP contribution.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>3. At Death: Probate Code &sect; 5305</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Joint Title at Death</h4>
      <p>For property held in <strong>joint tenancy</strong> between spouses, there is a presumption that the property is CP for purposes of the surviving spouse's rights at death&mdash;but only if the party can show the property was acquired with CP funds. Under Prob. Code &sect; 5305, the surviving spouse may trace to show that the joint tenancy property was acquired with CP, entitling the survivor to the full property (their 1/2 as CP + the decedent's 1/2 that passes by survivorship).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== SPECIAL PRESUMPTION ===== -->
    <h3>G. Special Presumption for Married Woman's Acquisitions (Pre-1975)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Historical Rule</h4>
      <p>Before 1975, there was a presumption that property taken in a <strong>married woman's name alone</strong> was her <strong>separate property</strong>. This was based on the former Civil Code &sect; 5110. After 1975, this presumption was abolished. However, it still applies to property acquired <em>before</em> 1975 and may appear on essays involving older property acquisitions.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== SPECIAL ASSET TYPES ===== -->
    <h2>III. Special Asset Types</h2>

    <h3>A. Business and Professional Goodwill</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>In re Marriage of Foster (1974) / In re Marriage of McTiernan (2005)</h4>
      <p>The <strong>goodwill</strong> of a business or professional practice is a community asset to the extent it was built up during the marriage. Even a sole practitioner's professional goodwill is divisible. Courts use either a <strong>capitalization-of-excess-earnings</strong> method or a <strong>market/buy-sell</strong> method to value goodwill.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>CP Interest in SP Business: Pereira vs. Van Camp</h4>
    <p>When a spouse's SP business increases in value during the marriage, the court must allocate returns between SP (capital appreciation) and CP (community labor).</p>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Method</th><th>Approach</th><th>When Used</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Pereira</strong></td>
          <td>SP gets a <strong>fair rate of return</strong> on the initial SP investment; all remaining profits are CP (attributable to community labor).</td>
          <td>When the <strong>spouse's labor and effort</strong> were the primary cause of the business's growth.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Van Camp</strong></td>
          <td>CP gets a <strong>reasonable salary</strong> for the spouse's services; all remaining profits are SP (attributable to the character of the asset).</td>
          <td>When the <strong>nature of the SP asset</strong> itself (e.g., unique property, market forces) was the primary cause of the growth.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Choosing Pereira vs. Van Camp</h4>
      <p><strong>Pereira</strong> favors the community (larger CP share) and is used when the spouse's efforts drove the growth. <strong>Van Camp</strong> favors the SP owner (larger SP share) and is used when the asset's intrinsic nature drove the growth. The court has <strong>discretion</strong> to choose whichever method achieves a more equitable result, and can even use a <strong>hybrid</strong> approach.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>B. Personal Injury Awards</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 780, 781, 2603</h4>
      <p>Personal injury damages received by a spouse are characterized based on <strong>when the cause of action arose</strong>:</p>
    </div>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Timing of Injury</th><th>Character</th><th>Division Rule</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>During marriage, before separation</strong></td><td>Community property</td><td>At divorce: <strong>entirely to the injured spouse</strong>, unless justice requires otherwise. (Fam. Code &sect; 2603.)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>After date of separation</strong></td><td>Separate property of injured spouse</td><td>No division; it belongs entirely to the injured spouse.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Against the other spouse</strong></td><td>SP of injured spouse</td><td>Damages from interspousal torts are the injured spouse's SP. (Fam. Code &sect; 781.)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>C. Retirement Benefits</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>In re Marriage of Brown (1976) &mdash; The Time Rule</h4>
      <p>Retirement benefits are characterized as CP to the extent they were earned during the marriage. The <strong>time rule</strong> allocates the CP interest:</p>
      <p><strong>CP share = (years of service during marriage / total years of service) &times; total benefit</strong></p>
      <p>Each spouse receives 1/2 of the CP share.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Division Methods</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>In-kind division (preferred):</strong> Each spouse receives their share of the benefits as they are paid out. Implemented through a <em>Qualified Domestic Relations Order</em> (QDRO) for private plans or a similar court order for public plans.</li>
      <li><strong>Present-value offset:</strong> The court calculates the present value of the CP share and offsets it against other CP assets. One spouse receives the pension; the other receives assets of equivalent value.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Hug Formula (Unvested Benefits)</h4>
      <p>For benefits that are <strong>not yet vested</strong>, the court uses the <em>In re Marriage of Hug</em> (1984) "time rule" with a contingency factor: if the benefits never vest, the nonemployee spouse receives nothing. The nonemployee spouse's share is determined <strong>if and when</strong> the benefits vest and are received.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>D. Stock Options</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>In re Marriage of Hug / In re Marriage of Nelson (1986)</h4>
      <p>Stock options are characterized using a <strong>time rule</strong> that considers why the options were granted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Options granted for past services:</strong> CP share = (years of service during marriage before grant / total years of service before grant) &times; options.</li>
        <li><strong>Options granted to incentivize future services:</strong> CP share = (years of service during marriage after grant through vesting / total years from grant through vesting) &times; options.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid grants:</strong> Courts may apportion between past and future service components.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>E. Education and Training</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 2641</h4>
      <p>A professional degree or license is <strong>not</strong> a divisible asset. However, the community is entitled to <strong>reimbursement</strong> for CP funds used for education or training that substantially enhances the earning capacity of a spouse. Reimbursement includes costs of tuition, fees, books, and living expenses paid from CP.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Exceptions (no reimbursement required):</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>The community has <strong>already substantially benefited</strong> from the education (e.g., the degree was earned early in the marriage and the community enjoyed the higher income for 10+ years).</li>
      <li>The other spouse also received CP-funded education of <strong>substantially equal value</strong>.</li>
      <li>The need for SP support is reduced because of the education.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <h4>Rebuttable Presumption</h4>
      <p>If the education was completed <strong>less than 10 years</strong> before filing for dissolution, there is a <em>rebuttable presumption</em> that the community has <strong>not</strong> substantially benefited. If completed <strong>more than 10 years</strong> before filing, the presumption is that the community <strong>has</strong> substantially benefited.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>F. Life Insurance</h3>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Type</th><th>Characterization Rule</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Term life insurance</strong></td>
          <td>No cash value; the character depends on <strong>which funds paid the last premium</strong> (the premium that was in effect at death). If CP paid, the proceeds are CP; if SP paid, the proceeds are SP.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Whole life insurance</strong></td>
          <td>Has cash value (an asset). The cash value is apportioned based on the <strong>proportion of premiums paid</strong> with CP vs. SP funds over the life of the policy. Pro rata allocation applies.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>G. Disability and Severance Pay</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 2603.5</h4>
      <p>Disability pay and severance pay are characterized based on <strong>what they replace</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If disability/severance <strong>replaces lost future earnings</strong> (post-separation), it is <strong>SP</strong>.</li>
        <li>If disability/severance <strong>replaces retirement benefits</strong>, it is apportioned like retirement benefits (using the time rule).</li>
        <li>If disability/severance <strong>replaces lost earnings during marriage</strong>, it is <strong>CP</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>H. Moore/Marsden Apportionment (SP Property with CP Contributions)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>In re Marriage of Moore (1980) / In re Marriage of Marsden (1982)</h4>
      <p>When one spouse owns SP real property and <strong>CP funds are used to pay the mortgage</strong> during marriage, the community acquires a <strong>pro rata interest</strong> in the property. The formula:</p>
      <p><strong>CP interest = (CP payments toward principal / purchase price) &times; FMV at time of division</strong></p>
      <p>This gives the community a share of the <em>appreciation</em>, not merely reimbursement of payments. The SP owner retains the balance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>Key Nuance</h4>
      <p>Only payments toward <strong>principal</strong> count for Moore/Marsden. Interest payments, taxes, and insurance paid from CP do <em>not</em> increase the community's pro rata share (though they may give rise to a right of reimbursement under Fam. Code &sect; 2640).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL ===== -->
    <h2>IV. Management and Control</h2>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 1100&ndash;1102</h4>
      <p>California grants <strong>equal management and control</strong> of CP to both spouses, subject to specific exceptions.</p>

      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 2550</h4>
      <p>At divorce, the court <strong>shall divide the community estate equally</strong> between the parties. This is a <em>mandatory</em> equal division, unlike equitable distribution states that allow unequal division based on fairness factors.</p>

    <h3>B. Exceptions to Equal Division</h3>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Misappropriation / breach of fiduciary duty (Fam. Code &sect; 1101(g)):</strong> If a spouse has deliberately misappropriated CP, the court may award the <strong>entire asset</strong> (or its value plus attorney fees) to the other spouse.</li>
      <li><strong>Personal injury awards (Fam. Code &sect; 2603):</strong> CP personal injury awards are assigned <strong>entirely to the injured spouse</strong>, unless justice requires otherwise.</li>
      <li><strong>Educational debt:</strong> Assigned to the spouse who received the education. (&sect; 2641.)</li>
      <li><strong>Negative community estate:</strong> If debts exceed assets, the court assigns debts according to relative ability to pay.</li>
      <li><strong>Unpaid family support / child support:</strong> The court may make an unequal division to account for unpaid support obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliberate destruction of CP:</strong> If a spouse deliberately destroyed, dissipated, or concealed CP, the court may compensate the other spouse with a larger share of the remaining CP.</li>

    <h3>C. Reimbursement Rights (&sect; 2640)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 2640</h4>
      <p>A party is entitled to reimbursement for SP contributions to the <strong>acquisition</strong> of CP (not improvements or payments of CP debts).

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Pattern 1: Classification and Division at Divorce</strong></summary>
      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <h4>Typical Fact Pattern</h4>
        <p>Husband and Wife marry. During the marriage they acquire various assets: a home, retirement benefits, a business, personal injury settlement, bank accounts. One spouse has pre-marriage assets. They divorce.</p>
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Asset-by-asset analysis:</strong> Classify each asset as CP, SP, or mixed. For each asset ask: When was it acquired? With what funds? Was there a transmutation?</li>
          <li><strong>Apply special rules:</strong> Retirement (time rule), business goodwill (Pereira/Van Camp), PI awards (&sect; 2603), Moore/Marsden for mixed property.</li>
          <li><strong>Division:</strong> CP is divided equally (&sect; 2550). SP goes to the owning spouse. Reimbursement under &sect; 2640 for SP contributions to CP. Education reimbursement under &sect; 2641.</li>
          <li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Check for misappropriation, deliberate destruction, or breach of fiduciary duty.</li>

      <summary><strong>Pattern 2: Death of a Spouse &mdash; What Passes?</strong></summary>
      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <h4>Typical Fact Pattern</h4>
        <p>Spouse dies with a will devising "all my property" to a third party. Various assets exist: CP, SP, QCP, joint tenancy property. The surviving spouse objects.</p>
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Classify all assets:</strong> Determine what is CP, SP, and QCP.</li>
          <li><strong>Surviving spouse's automatic rights:</strong> Surviving spouse owns 1/2 of CP outright&mdash;it is not part of the estate. Surviving spouse gets 1/2 of QCP.</li>
          <li><strong>Decedent's disposable estate:</strong> Decedent can devise their 1/2 of CP, their 1/2 of QCP, and all of their SP.</li>
          <li><strong>Joint tenancy:</strong> Passes by right of survivorship unless Prob. Code &sect; 5305 reclassification applies.</li>
          <li><strong>Intestate share:</strong> If no will for certain property, surviving spouse receives the decedent's 1/2 of CP; for SP, apply Prob. Code &sect; 6401.</li>

        <p>Spouse receives an inheritance (SP) and deposits it into a joint bank account with marital earnings (CP). Various purchases are made from the account. At divorce, one spouse claims certain assets are SP.</p>
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identify commingling:</strong> SP deposited into a CP account creates a commingled fund.</li>
          <li><strong>Apply tracing:</strong> Determine whether the SP proponent can use direct tracing or the exhaustion method.</li>
          <li><strong>If tracing fails:</strong> The CP presumption controls; the property is CP.</li>
          <li><strong>Transmutation?</strong> Merely depositing SP into a joint account is not a transmutation (no express written declaration).</li>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <h4>Typical Fact Pattern</h4>
        <p>Before marriage, one spouse presents a premarital agreement that waives CP rights and/or spousal support. At divorce, the other spouse challenges enforcement.</p>
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Formal requirements:</strong> Written? Signed by both parties?</li>
          <li><strong>Voluntariness (&sect; 1615(c)):</strong> Independent counsel or written waiver? 7-day waiting period? Language proficiency? No duress/fraud?</li>
          <li><strong>Unconscionability:</strong> Was the agreement unconscionable when signed? Was there adequate disclosure?</li>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Classify property acquired out-of-state:</strong> Would it have been CP if acquired while domiciled in CA? If yes, it is QCP.</li>
          <li><strong>At divorce:</strong> QCP is divided equally, just like CP.</li>

    <!-- ===== EXAM TIPS ===== -->
    <h2>XII. Exam Tips</h2>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>1. Go Asset by Asset</h4>
      <p>The single most important structural decision in a CP essay is to <strong>organize your answer asset by asset</strong>. For each asset: (1) identify it, (2) characterize it (CP/SP/mixed/QCP), (3) explain why, (4) state how it is divided. Do not try to discuss all the law first and then apply it&mdash;weave analysis into each asset discussion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>2. Always State the General CP Presumption</h4>
      <p>Begin every characterization analysis by stating: "All property acquired during marriage while domiciled in California is presumed CP. The party claiming SP has the burden of proof." This frames every issue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>3. Watch the Dates</h4>
      <p>Three critical dates: (1) <strong>date of marriage</strong>, (2) <strong>date of separation</strong>, and (3) <strong>date of any transmutation</strong>. Also note if any acquisitions occurred pre-1975 (married woman's presumption) or pre-1985 (oral transmutation allowed).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <h4>4. Know Which Division Context You Are In</h4>
      <p>The rules differ significantly depending on whether you are dividing at <strong>divorce</strong> vs. at <strong>death</strong>. For example: PI awards go entirely to the injured spouse at divorce (&sect; 2603) but are simply CP (each spouse owns 1/2) at death. QCP is recognized at divorce and at the acquiring spouse's death, but NOT at the non-acquiring spouse's death. Always identify the context first.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>5. Do Not Overlook Reimbursement</h4>
      <p>Even if an asset is classified entirely as CP or SP, check for reimbursement rights: &sect; 2640 (SP contributions to CP acquisition), &sect; 2641 (education), Moore/Marsden (CP contributions to SP mortgage), Watts charges (exclusive post-separation use of CP), and Epstein credits (SP used to pay CP debts post-separation).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <h4>6. Fiduciary Duty is a Favorite Crossover</h4>
      <p>If any fact suggests one spouse is hiding assets, transferring CP without consent, or managing CP recklessly, discuss the <strong>fiduciary duty between spouses</strong> (Fam. Code &sect; 1100(e)). The remedy can include an unequal division, attorney fees, or awarding 100% of a misappropriated asset to the injured spouse.</p>
