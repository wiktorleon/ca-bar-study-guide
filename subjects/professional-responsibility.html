         PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY — FULL STUDY GUIDE
         ============================================================ -->

    <h1>Professional Responsibility</h1>

    <p class="subtitle">Regulation of the legal profession, duties to clients, courts, and third parties under the ABA Model Rules and California Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h4>California Emphasis</h4>
      <p>The CA Bar tests Professional Responsibility (PR) on <strong>every exam</strong> as either an essay or a performance test component. California adopted new Rules of Professional Conduct effective November 1, 2018, which largely track the ABA Model Rules but retain important California-specific differences. You <strong>must</strong> discuss both ABA and California rules on every PR essay. Always state the ABA rule first, then note how California differs.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============================================================
         SECTION 1: OVERVIEW & SOURCES OF REGULATION
         ============================================================ -->

    <h2>I. Overview &amp; Sources of Regulation</h2>

    <h3>A. Sources of Professional Responsibility Law</h3>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (MR):</strong> The national standard adopted (with variations) by most states. Not binding in California, but the CA Bar expects you to analyze under both ABA and CA rules.</li>
      <li><strong>California Rules of Professional Conduct (CA RPC):</strong> Adopted by the California Supreme Court, effective November 1, 2018. These are the binding rules for California attorneys.</li>
      <li><strong>California Business &amp; Professions Code (B&amp;P):</strong> Sections 6000-6228 govern attorney conduct, including the duty of confidentiality (B&amp;P 6068(e)), grounds for discipline, and unauthorized practice.</li>
      <li><strong>California State Bar Act:</strong> The statutory framework establishing the State Bar and governing admission, discipline, and regulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Case Law:</strong> California and federal courts interpret and supplement the rules. Key cases (e.g., <em>Flatt v. Superior Court</em>, <em>In re Complex Asbestos Litigation</em>) shape disqualification and conflict doctrines.</li>
      <li><strong>ABA Formal &amp; Informal Ethics Opinions:</strong> Persuasive authority interpreting the Model Rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers:</strong> Persuasive authority, sometimes cited by California courts.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>Exam Tip</h4>
      <p>On the CA Bar, always structure your PR essay by stating the ABA Model Rule, analyzing it, then pivoting: "Under California, the rule differs in that..." This dual-track approach is expected and will earn maximum points.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>B. Admission to the Bar &amp; Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)</h3>

    <h4>Admission Requirements</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Character &amp; Fitness:</strong> Applicants must demonstrate good moral character. Material omissions on the bar application can be grounds for denial.</li>
      <li><strong>Educational Requirements:</strong> Graduation from an ABA-accredited or California-accredited law school (or other qualifying path).</li>
      <li><strong>Bar Examination:</strong> Passage of the California Bar Exam.</li>
      <li><strong>MPRE:</strong> Passage of the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination.</li>
      <li><strong>Duty to Disclose:</strong> Applicants must disclose all material information, including criminal history and academic misconduct. Failure to disclose is often worse than the underlying conduct (MR 8.1).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Unauthorized Practice of Law</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Practicing law without a license in the jurisdiction. Includes giving legal advice, drafting legal documents, and appearing in court.</li>
      <li><strong>Multijurisdictional Practice (MR 5.5):</strong> A lawyer admitted in one state may not establish an office or hold out as practicing in another state unless an exception applies (temporary practice reasonably related to home-state practice, pro hac vice, arbitration/mediation, or association with local counsel).</li>
      <li><strong>California B&amp;P 6125-6127:</strong> Practicing law in California without bar membership is a misdemeanor. California recognizes limited exceptions for in-house counsel registered with the State Bar and certain federal practice.</li>
      <li><strong>Assisting UPL (MR 5.5(a)):</strong> A lawyer must not assist another in the unauthorized practice of law.</li>

         SECTION 2: CORE DUTIES TO CLIENTS
         ============================================================ -->

    <h2>II. Core Duties to Clients</h2>

    <h3>A. Competence (MR 1.1 / CA RPC 1.1)</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h4>MR 1.1 &mdash; Competence</h4>
      <p>"A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation."</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Legal Knowledge &amp; Skill:</strong> The lawyer must have or acquire the knowledge and skill needed for the matter. A lawyer new to a field can become competent through reasonable study or by associating with an experienced lawyer.</li>
      <li><strong>Thoroughness &amp; Preparation:</strong> Adequate investigation, research, and analysis are required for any matter undertaken.</li>
      <li><strong>California RPC 1.1:</strong> Tracks MR 1.1 closely. A lawyer must not "intentionally, recklessly, with gross negligence, or repeatedly fail to perform legal services with competence."</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h4>California Distinction</h4>
      <p>CA RPC 1.1 adds a <strong>mental state requirement</strong> for discipline: the incompetence must be <em>intentional, reckless, grossly negligent, or repeated</em>. A single negligent error, standing alone, is generally insufficient for discipline (but may support a malpractice claim).</p>
    </div>

    <h3>B. Scope of Representation &amp; Allocation of Authority (MR 1.2 / CA RPC 1.2)</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h4>MR 1.2 &mdash; Scope of Representation</h4>
      <p>A lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the <strong>objectives</strong> of representation and, in consultation with the client, take reasonable action. The client decides:</p>

    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Avoiding Procrastination:</strong> A lawyer must pursue a matter despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience, and must not neglect a client's matter.</li>
      <li><strong>Workload Management:</strong> Taking on more work than can be competently handled violates the diligence duty.</li>
      <li><strong>CA RPC 1.3:</strong> Substantially identical. A lawyer must not "intentionally, repeatedly, recklessly, or with gross negligence" fail to act with reasonable diligence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Communication (MR 1.4 / CA RPC 1.4)</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">

      <p>A lawyer shall: (a) promptly inform the client of decisions requiring informed consent; keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; (b) explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary for the client to make informed decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Settlement Offers:</strong> A lawyer must promptly communicate all settlement offers and plea bargain offers to the client. The decision to accept or reject belongs to the client.</li>
      <li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Many rules require "informed consent" (MR 1.0(e)): agreement after the lawyer has communicated adequate information and explanation about the material risks and reasonably available alternatives.</li>
      <li><strong>CA RPC 1.4:</strong> Tracks MR 1.4. California adds that a lawyer must keep a client "reasonably informed about significant developments" relating to the representation.</li>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h4>California Distinction &mdash; B&amp;P 6148 Written Fee Agreements</h4>
      <p>California requires a <strong>written fee agreement</strong> whenever the total fee is expected to exceed $1,000 (exceptions: corporate clients, repeat clients with a prior written agreement, emergency/special circumstances). The agreement must state: (1) the basis for compensation, (2) the nature of the legal services, (3) the lawyer's and client's responsibilities. Noncompliance makes the agreement <strong>voidable</strong> by the client, and the attorney bears the burden of proving the fee is reasonable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>Exam Tip &mdash; "Unconscionable" vs. "Unreasonable"</h4>
      <p>Always note this difference. ABA uses "unreasonable" (easier to prove violation). California uses "unconscionable" (harder to prove). However, on the exam, most fact patterns involving excessive fees will likely meet either standard. Still, state the distinction to earn points.</p>

      <h4>Critical Distinction: Ethical Duty of Confidentiality vs. Attorney-Client Privilege</h4>
      <p>These are <strong>NOT</strong> the same thing. The CA Bar frequently tests the distinction. You must address both separately.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ethical Duty of Confidentiality</strong> (MR 1.6 / CA RPC 1.6 / B&amp;P 6068(e)): Broader. Covers <em>all</em> information relating to the representation, regardless of source. Applies at all times, not just in proceedings. Cannot be waived by someone other than the client.</li>
        <li><strong>Attorney-Client Privilege</strong> (Evidence Code 950-962): Narrower. Applies only to <em>confidential communications</em> between attorney and client (or their agents) made for the purpose of seeking/giving legal advice. An evidentiary rule that applies in proceedings. Can be waived.</li>

      <li><strong>Broadly defined:</strong> "Information relating to the representation" includes everything learned during or relating to the representation, from any source &mdash; not just what the client tells you.</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Survives the termination of the attorney-client relationship and even the death of the client.</li>
      <li><strong>Implied Authorization:</strong> A lawyer may disclose information impliedly authorized to carry out the representation (e.g., telling co-counsel information needed to work on the case).</li>

      <li><strong>Advertising is protected speech:</strong> Attorney advertising is commercial speech protected by the First Amendment (<em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona</em>). Truthful, non-misleading advertising cannot be categorically banned.</li>

      <li><strong>Specialist designations:</strong> A lawyer generally may not claim to be a "specialist" or "certified specialist" unless certified by an approved organization (MR 7.2).

      <li><strong>Duty:</strong> An attorney owes a duty of care to the client (and in limited circumstances to intended third-party beneficiaries, e.g., beneficiaries of a will the attorney negligently drafted).</li>
      <li><strong>Breach:</strong> The attorney failed to exercise the competence and diligence normally exercised by attorneys in similar circumstances. Expert testimony is generally required to establish the standard of care.</li>
      <li><strong>Causation:</strong> The client must prove "but for" causation. In litigation malpractice, this means proving the <strong>"case within a case"</strong> &mdash; the client must show they would have prevailed in the underlying action but for the attorney's negligence.</li>
      <li><strong>Damages:</strong> Actual damages (not just nominal). The client must prove measurable financial harm resulting from the breach.</li>

    <h3>B. Breach of Fiduciary Duty</h3>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>An attorney is a fiduciary of the client. Breach of fiduciary duty is a <strong>separate cause of action</strong> from negligence-based malpractice.</li>

      <li>The "case within a case" requirement may not apply to fiduciary duty claims (e.g., misappropriation of funds does not require proving the underlying litigation would have succeeded).</li>

      <h4>Exam Tip &mdash; "Triple Threat" Analysis</h4>
      <p>When a PR essay involves attorney misconduct causing harm, consider three separate consequences: (1) <strong>Discipline</strong> by the State Bar (suspension, disbarment); (2) <strong>Civil malpractice liability</strong> (negligence, breach of fiduciary duty); (3) <strong>Disqualification</strong> from the representation (judicial remedy). Each has different standards and requirements.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Pattern 1: The Conflicted Lawyer</strong></summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Fact Pattern:</strong> An attorney represents Client A. A new prospective client, Client B, approaches the attorney with a case that may be adverse to Client A's interests, or involves information learned from Client A's representation.</p>
        <p><strong>Issues to Spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Current client conflict (MR 1.7 / CA RPC 1.7) &mdash; direct adversity or material limitation</li>
          <li>Former client conflict (MR 1.9 / CA RPC 1.9) if Client A is a former client &mdash; substantial relationship test</li>
          <li>Prospective client duties (MR 1.18) if Client B is never retained</li>
          <li>Imputed conflicts (MR 1.10) &mdash; does the conflict extend to the whole firm?</li>
          <li>Consentability analysis &mdash; can the conflict be waived? Were proper consents obtained?</li>

      <summary><strong>Pattern 2: The Secret-Keeping Dilemma</strong></summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Fact Pattern:</strong> During representation, a lawyer learns that the client intends to commit a crime, perpetrate a fraud, or that past testimony was false. The lawyer must decide what to reveal and to whom.</p>
        <p><strong>Issues to Spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ethical duty of confidentiality (MR 1.6 / CA RPC 1.6 / B&amp;P 6068(e)) &mdash; scope and exceptions</li>

      <summary><strong>Pattern 3: The Fee Dispute</strong></summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Fact Pattern:</strong> A lawyer charges fees that seem excessive, enters a contingency agreement with deficient terms, splits fees improperly, or disputes with a client over the fee.</p>
        <p><strong>Issues to Spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fee reasonableness (MR 1.5 "unreasonable" vs. CA "unconscionable")</li>
          <li>Written fee agreement (B&amp;P 6148 requirement if fee exceeds $1,000)</li>

      <summary><strong>Pattern 4: The Lawyer Who Talks Too Much</strong></summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Fact Pattern:</strong> A lawyer communicates with a represented party, gives advice to an unrepresented person, makes improper solicitations, or reveals confidential information in casual conversation or public settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Issues to Spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>No-contact rule (MR 4.2 / CA RPC 4.2) &mdash; communicating with represented persons</li>
          <li>Unrepresented persons (MR 4.3) &mdash; duty not to mislead about lawyer's role</li>

      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Fact Pattern:</strong> During litigation, a lawyer faces issues of candor to the tribunal, handling evidence, dealing with perjury, or acting as both advocate and witness.</p>
        <p><strong>Issues to Spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Candor to tribunal (MR 3.3) &mdash; false statements, adverse authority, false evidence</li>
          <li>Perjury by client or witness &mdash; dissuade, remedial measures, disclosure (ABA) vs. narrative approach (CA criminal)</li>
          <li>Fairness to opposing party (MR 3.4) &mdash; evidence destruction, discovery abuse</li>
          <li>Advocate-witness rule (MR 3.7) &mdash; lawyer likely to be a necessary witness</li>

         SECTION 20: EXAM TIPS
         ============================================================ -->

    <h2>XX. Exam Tips</h2>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>1. Always Discuss Both ABA and California Rules</h4>
      <p>Every PR essay requires dual-track analysis. State the ABA Model Rule, analyze under the facts, then state how California differs and analyze under California's rule. Even if the analysis is the same, explicitly say so.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>2. Use Rule Numbers</h4>
      <p>Citing specific rule numbers (MR 1.7, CA RPC 1.6, B&amp;P 6068(e)) demonstrates mastery and adds precision to your analysis. You do not need to quote the full rule text, but identifying the rule number is valuable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>3. Distinguish Privilege from Confidentiality</h4>
      <p>Whenever a question involves a lawyer revealing information, address both doctrines separately. Define each, explain the different scope, and analyze exceptions under each. This distinction is one of the most frequently tested topics.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>4. Identify All Issues Before Writing</h4>
      <p>PR fact patterns typically raise 5-8 distinct issues. Use the checklist above to spot them all before you begin writing. Allocate time proportionally to the difficulty and depth of each issue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>5. State the Consequences</h4>
      <p>For each violation, state the potential consequences: (1) disciplinary action (reproval, suspension, disbarment), (2) civil malpractice liability, (3) disqualification from the representation, (4) criminal liability (where applicable, e.g., trust account misappropriation). This demonstrates comprehensive analysis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>6. Remember the "Reasonable Lawyer" Standard</h4>
      <p>Many rules turn on what a "reasonable" lawyer would do or believe. Use this as your analytical framework when applying rules to facts. The question is not what the best lawyer would do, but what a reasonably competent lawyer would do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>7. Watch for Multiple-Relationship Fact Patterns</h4>
      <p>The hardest PR questions involve a lawyer navigating duties to multiple parties simultaneously: current clients, former clients, the court, and third parties. Map out who the lawyer owes duties to and what those duties require. Look for tensions between competing duties (e.g., candor vs. confidentiality).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h4>8. Do Not Forget Imputation</h4>
      <p>If one lawyer in a firm has a conflict, consider whether it is imputed to the entire firm. Then consider whether screening can cure the imputation. This is an easy point to earn that many examinees miss.</p>
