    <!-- ===== OVERVIEW ===== -->
    <h1>Criminal Procedure</h1>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Bar Exam Significance:</strong> Criminal Procedure is one of the most heavily tested subjects on the California Bar Exam, appearing regularly on essay questions (often cross-listed with Criminal Law and Evidence) and comprising a significant portion of the MBE. The subject centers on constitutional protections found in the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendments. California distinctions under Proposition 8 and independent state constitutional grounds are critical for full-credit answers.
    </div>

    <h2>Overview &amp; Framework</h2>

    <p>Criminal Procedure governs the process by which the government investigates, prosecutes, and punishes crime. The field is dominated by constitutional rights applied to the states through the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause. On the bar exam, the analysis typically follows the chronological flow of a criminal case: investigation (search &amp; seizure, interrogation, identification), pretrial proceedings, trial rights, and post-trial matters.</p>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Master Framework &mdash; The Chronological Approach:</strong> When you see a Criminal Procedure essay, organize your answer chronologically: (1) Was there a valid search/seizure? (2) Were any statements properly obtained? (3) Were identification procedures fair? (4) Were pretrial rights honored? (5) Were trial rights satisfied? (6) Are post-trial remedies available? Within each stage, apply the constitutional amendment at issue.

    <!-- ===== FOURTH AMENDMENT ===== -->
    <h2>I. The Fourth Amendment &mdash; Search &amp; Seizure</h2>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Text:</strong> "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."
    </div>

    <h3>A. Threshold Questions: Is It a "Search"? Is It a "Seizure"?</h3>

    <h4>1. Reasonable Expectation of Privacy (REP) &mdash; <em>Katz v. United States</em> (1967)</h4>
    <p>A "search" occurs when the government violates a person's <strong>reasonable expectation of privacy</strong> (REP). The two-part <em>Katz</em> test requires:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Subjective expectation:</strong> The person actually (subjectively) expected privacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Objective reasonableness:</strong> Society is prepared to recognize that expectation as reasonable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Alternative: Trespass Theory &mdash;</strong> <em>United States v. Jones</em> (2012): A search also occurs when the government physically intrudes on a constitutionally protected area (persons, houses, papers, effects) to obtain information.</p>

    <h4>REP EXISTS (Protected):</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Home interior and curtilage (area immediately surrounding home)</li>
      <li>Hotel/motel rooms (during rental period)</li>
      <li>Sealed luggage and personal containers</li>
      <li>Phone booths (closed) &mdash; <em>Katz</em></li>
      <li>Cell phone contents &mdash; <em>Riley v. California</em> (2014)</li>
      <li>Long-term GPS tracking &mdash; <em>Carpenter v. United States</em> (2018) (cell-site location info, CSLI)</li>
      <li>Thermal imaging of a home &mdash; <em>Kyllo v. United States</em> (2001)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>NO REP (Not Protected &mdash; Third-Party / Open Fields Doctrines):</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Open fields</strong> &mdash; areas beyond curtilage, even if fenced/posted "No Trespassing" (<em>Oliver v. United States</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Anything in plain view</strong> from a lawful vantage point</li>
      <li><strong>Garbage left at curb</strong> for collection &mdash; <em>California v. Greenwood</em></li>
      <li><strong>Third-party doctrine:</strong> Information voluntarily conveyed to third parties &mdash; bank records (<em>Miller</em>), pen registers/phone numbers dialed (<em>Smith v. Maryland</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Aerial surveillance</strong> from navigable airspace &mdash; <em>California v. Ciraolo</em></li>
      <li><strong>Dog sniff</strong> of luggage in public place (not a search) &mdash; <em>Caballes</em>; BUT dog sniff at front door of home IS a search &mdash; <em>Florida v. Jardines</em></li>
      <li>Paint scrapings from car exterior</li>
      <li>Voice or handwriting exemplars</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-warning">
      <strong>Watch Out &mdash; <em>Carpenter</em> Limitation:</strong> The Supreme Court carved out CSLI (historical cell-site location information) from the third-party doctrine. Acquiring 7+ days of CSLI is a search requiring a warrant. Future cases may further erode the third-party doctrine for digital records. On the bar, note the tension when digital surveillance is at issue.
    </div>

    <h4>2. "Seizure" of a Person</h4>
    <p>A person is "seized" when, in view of all circumstances, a reasonable person would not feel free to leave or to terminate the encounter. (<em>United States v. Mendenhall</em>; <em>Florida v. Bostick</em>)</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Not a seizure:</strong> Consensual encounters &mdash; officer approaches on street, asks questions; person is free to leave.</li>
      <li><strong>Seizure (stop):</strong> Officer's show of authority that restrains liberty &mdash; activated lights, commands to stop, physical touching. For a show of authority, the person must also <em>submit</em> to be seized. (<em>California v. Hodari D.</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Seizure (arrest):</strong> Full custodial arrest &mdash; greater restraint on liberty than a stop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Standing</h4>
    <p>To challenge a search or seizure, the defendant must have <strong>standing</strong> &mdash; i.e., the defendant's own 4th Amendment rights must have been violated. A defendant cannot vicariously assert another person's 4th Amendment rights. (<em>Rakas v. Illinois</em>)</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Homeowner/renter:</strong> Always has standing for search of their home.</li>
      <li><strong>Overnight guest:</strong> Has standing in the host's home. (<em>Minnesota v. Olson</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Brief visitor / commercial guest:</strong> No standing. (<em>Minnesota v. Carter</em> &mdash; persons present briefly for commercial purposes, e.g., bagging drugs, lack REP.)</li>
      <li><strong>Car passengers:</strong> Passenger lacks standing to challenge search of the vehicle unless they own it or have a possessory interest in the item seized. BUT passenger has standing to challenge the <em>stop</em> itself. (<em>Brendlin v. California</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. The Warrant Requirement</h3>

    <p>Searches and seizures conducted <strong>without a valid warrant</strong> are presumptively unreasonable. The government bears the burden of showing an exception applies.</p>

    <h4>Valid Warrant Requirements:</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Probable cause:</strong> A fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched. Determined under the <strong>totality of the circumstances</strong> test. (<em>Illinois v. Gates</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Neutral and detached magistrate:</strong> Cannot be a law enforcement officer or someone with a financial stake in issuing warrants. (<em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire</em>; <em>Connally v. Georgia</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Particularity:</strong> The warrant must particularly describe (a) the place to be searched and (b) the items to be seized. General warrants are invalid.</li>
      <li><strong>Proper execution:</strong> Generally must be executed within a reasonable time; officers must "knock and announce" (but violation does not trigger exclusionary rule &mdash; <em>Hudson v. Michigan</em>).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Informant Tips &amp; Probable Cause:</strong> Under <em>Illinois v. Gates</em>, courts use the <strong>totality of the circumstances</strong> test to evaluate whether an informant's tip establishes probable cause. Relevant factors: basis of knowledge, veracity/reliability, corroboration by police. The old <em>Aguilar-Spinelli</em> two-prong test (basis of knowledge + veracity) is no longer the federal standard but may still appear in some state analyses.
    </div>

    <h3>C. Exceptions to the Warrant Requirement</h3>

    <div class="mnemonic">
      <h4>Mnemonic: "SPACESHIP" &mdash; Warrant Exceptions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S</strong> &mdash; Search Incident to Lawful Arrest</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong> &mdash; Plain View</li>
        <li><strong>A</strong> &mdash; Automobile Exception</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong> &mdash; Consent</li>
        <li><strong>E</strong> &mdash; Exigent Circumstances / Hot Pursuit</li>
        <li><strong>S</strong> &mdash; Stop &amp; Frisk (Terry)</li>
        <li><strong>H</strong> &mdash; Hot Pursuit (overlaps with Exigent)</li>
        <li><strong>I</strong> &mdash; Inventory Searches</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong> &mdash; Special Needs / Administrative / Border</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>1. Search Incident to Lawful Arrest (SILA)</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Chimel v. California</em>:</strong> Upon a lawful custodial arrest, officers may search (a) the arrestee's <strong>person</strong> and (b) the area within the arrestee's <strong>immediate control</strong> (the "wingspan" or "lunge area") for weapons and evidence.
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Must be <strong>contemporaneous</strong> in time and place with the arrest.</li>
      <li><strong>No independent probable cause</strong> to search is required &mdash; the lawful arrest itself justifies the search.</li>
      <li><strong>Containers on or near the person</strong> may be opened.</li>
      <li><strong>Vehicles &mdash; <em>Arizona v. Gant</em> (2009):</strong> Search of vehicle passenger compartment incident to arrest is permitted ONLY if (a) the arrestee is <em>unsecured and within reaching distance</em> of the car at the time of the search, OR (b) it is <em>reasonable to believe</em> the vehicle contains evidence of the crime of arrest.</li>
      <li><strong>Cell phones &mdash; <em>Riley v. California</em> (2014):</strong> Officers may <strong>NOT</strong> search cell phone contents incident to arrest without a warrant. The immense storage capacity and personal nature of digital data require a warrant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Plain View Doctrine</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Horton v. California</em>:</strong> An officer may seize evidence in plain view if: (1) the officer is <strong>lawfully present</strong> at the vantage point; (2) the incriminating character of the item is <strong>immediately apparent</strong> (probable cause to believe it is contraband/evidence); and (3) the officer has a <strong>lawful right of access</strong> to the object.
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>The discovery need NOT be "inadvertent" (overruling earlier dicta in <em>Coolidge</em>).</li>
      <li><strong>Plain feel:</strong> If during a lawful Terry frisk, the officer feels an item whose incriminating character is immediately apparent, it may be seized. (<em>Minnesota v. Dickerson</em> &mdash; but no extended manipulation.)</li>
      <li><strong>Plain smell:</strong> Recognized in some jurisdictions but complicated by marijuana legalization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Automobile Exception</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Carroll v. United States</em>:</strong> If police have <strong>probable cause</strong> to believe a vehicle contains evidence of a crime or contraband, they may search the vehicle <strong>without a warrant</strong> &mdash; including all containers within the vehicle that could hold the item sought.
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Reduced expectation of privacy in vehicles (pervasive regulation) + mobility/exigency.</li>
      <li>Extends to <strong>any container</strong> in the car that could hold the evidence sought. (<em>United States v. Ross</em>)</li>
      <li>If probable cause is limited to a specific container (e.g., a suitcase), the search is limited to that container. (<em>California v. Acevedo</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>No exigency required</strong> &mdash; vehicle may be searched at the station later. (<em>Chambers v. Maroney</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Does NOT apply</strong> to motor homes being used as residences.</li>
      <li><strong>Passengers' belongings:</strong> May be searched if they could contain the item for which there is probable cause. (<em>Wyoming v. Houghton</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Consent</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule:</strong> A warrantless search is valid if a person with authority voluntarily consents. Consent must be given <strong>freely and voluntarily</strong> under the totality of the circumstances. (<em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte</em>)
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>No Miranda-style warnings</strong> required &mdash; police need not inform person of right to refuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Limited to the scope a reasonable person would understand the consent to cover. The person may <strong>revoke consent</strong> at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party consent:</strong> Valid if given by someone with <strong>actual authority</strong> (common authority/mutual use of the property) or <strong>apparent authority</strong> (officer reasonably believes person has authority to consent). (<em>Illinois v. Rodriguez</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Co-occupant present and objecting:</strong> If a physically present co-tenant expressly refuses consent, police may not rely on the other co-tenant's consent. (<em>Georgia v. Randolph</em>) BUT if the objecting co-tenant is removed (e.g., lawfully arrested), the remaining co-tenant can validly consent. (<em>Fernandez v. California</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Terry Stop &amp; Frisk</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Terry v. Ohio</em> (1968):</strong> An officer who has <strong>reasonable suspicion</strong> (articulable facts suggesting criminal activity) may briefly detain a person for investigation. If the officer reasonably believes the person is <strong>armed and dangerous</strong>, the officer may conduct a limited pat-down of outer clothing for weapons.
    </div>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Element</th><th>Stop (Investigatory Detention)</th><th>Frisk (Pat-Down)</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Standard</strong></td><td>Reasonable suspicion of criminal activity</td><td>Reasonable belief person is armed &amp; dangerous</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Scope</strong></td><td>Brief detention; ask questions, request ID</td><td>Pat-down of outer clothing for weapons only</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Duration</strong></td><td>Must be reasonably brief; no hard time limit</td><td>Limited to weapons check</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Key Cases</strong></td><td><em>Terry; Illinois v. Wardlow</em> (flight in high-crime area)</td><td><em>Terry; Minnesota v. Dickerson</em> (plain feel)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Vehicle stops:</strong> Reasonable suspicion of traffic violation justifies a stop. All occupants are "seized." (<em>Brendlin</em>) Officer may order driver and passengers out for safety. (<em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms</em>; <em>Maryland v. Wilson</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Must be reasonably related in scope and duration to the justification. Extending a traffic stop beyond its purpose to conduct a dog sniff violates the 4th Amendment unless there is independent reasonable suspicion. (<em>Rodriguez v. United States</em>, 2015)</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymous tips:</strong> Generally insufficient alone for reasonable suspicion unless corroborated by police observations or containing sufficient predictive detail. (<em>Alabama v. White</em>; <em>Florida v. J.L.</em>; <em>Navarette v. California</em> &mdash; 911 call with sufficient indicia of reliability may suffice.)</li>
      <li><strong>Pretextual stops:</strong> The officer's subjective motivation is irrelevant; if there is objective reasonable suspicion or probable cause, the stop is valid. (<em>Whren v. United States</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. Exigent Circumstances &amp; Hot Pursuit</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule:</strong> Police may make a warrantless entry into a home (or other protected area) when they have <strong>probable cause</strong> plus <strong>exigent circumstances</strong> that make obtaining a warrant impractical.
    </div>
    <p>Recognized exigent circumstances include:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Hot pursuit</strong> of a fleeing felon into a home. (<em>Warden v. Hayden</em>) BUT hot pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant does not categorically justify warrantless home entry. (<em>Lange v. California</em>, 2021)</li>
      <li><strong>Imminent destruction of evidence</strong> (e.g., flushing drugs). BUT police may not <em>create</em> the exigency through actual or threatened 4th Amendment violations. (<em>Kentucky v. King</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Risk of harm / emergency aid</strong> &mdash; reasonable belief someone inside needs immediate help.</li>
      <li><strong>Preventing suspect's escape</strong> when delay would allow flight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Inventory Searches</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule:</strong> Police may conduct a warrantless inventory search of a lawfully impounded vehicle (or a lawfully arrested person's belongings upon booking) if conducted pursuant to <strong>standardized department procedures</strong>. (<em>South Dakota v. Opperman</em>; <em>Colorado v. Bertine</em>)
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Purpose: Protect owner's property, protect police from claims, protect police from danger.</li>
      <li>Must follow <strong>standardized criteria</strong> &mdash; cannot be a pretext for investigation.</li>
      <li>Officers may open closed containers as part of inventory if procedures permit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8. Border Searches &amp; Special Needs / Administrative Searches</h4>

    <p><strong>Border Searches:</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Routine searches</strong> at the border (or functional equivalent) require <strong>no suspicion</strong> whatsoever. Luggage, vehicles, and persons may be searched.</li>
      <li><strong>Extended/intrusive searches</strong> (e.g., body cavity, forensic search of electronic devices) may require <strong>reasonable suspicion</strong>. (<em>United States v. Flores-Montano</em> &mdash; gas tank removal at border OK without suspicion; <em>Riley</em> may extend to digital searches at border.)</li>
      <li><strong>Roving border patrols</strong> (interior) need reasonable suspicion to stop; probable cause to search.</li>
      <li><strong>Fixed checkpoints</strong> (border/immigration) may stop vehicles briefly without suspicion. (<em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Special Needs / Administrative Searches:</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Administrative/regulatory inspections:</strong> Must have warrant or consent, BUT warrant standard is less than probable cause (administrative warrant under <em>Camara v. Municipal Court</em>).</li>
      <li><strong>Closely regulated industries:</strong> Warrantless inspections permitted. (<em>New York v. Burger</em> &mdash; auto junkyard.)</li>
      <li><strong>Drug testing:</strong> Permissible without suspicion for railroad employees after accidents (<em>Skinner</em>), Customs employees in drug-enforcement positions (<em>Von Raab</em>), and student athletes/extracurricular participants (<em>Vernonia; Earls</em>). NOT permissible as general-purpose crime control (e.g., hospital testing pregnant women and reporting to police &mdash; <em>Ferguson v. City of Charleston</em>).</li>
      <li><strong>Sobriety checkpoints:</strong> Permissible if conducted under neutral guidelines. (<em>Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Drug checkpoints:</strong> Impermissible &mdash; primary purpose is general crime control. (<em>City of Indianapolis v. Edmond</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>School searches:</strong> Reasonable suspicion standard (not probable cause). (<em>New Jersey v. T.L.O.</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Probation/parole searches:</strong> May be warrantless and suspicionless if a condition of supervision. (<em>Samson v. California</em> &mdash; parolees; <em>United States v. Knights</em> &mdash; probationers with reasonable suspicion.)</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== EXCLUSIONARY RULE ===== -->
    <h2>II. The Exclusionary Rule</h2>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Mapp v. Ohio</em> (1961):</strong> Evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search or seizure is <strong>inadmissible</strong> in the prosecution's case-in-chief. This is a judicially created remedy designed to <strong>deter police misconduct</strong>; it is not a personal constitutional right.
    </div>

    <h3>A. Fruit of the Poisonous Tree</h3>
    <p>The exclusionary rule extends not only to evidence directly obtained through the illegal action (the "primary evidence") but also to all evidence derived from the illegality &mdash; the <strong>"fruit of the poisonous tree."</strong> (<em>Wong Sun v. United States</em>)</p>

    <h3>B. Exceptions to the Exclusionary Rule</h3>

      <li>Reliance on binding appellate precedent later overruled &mdash; <em>Davis v. United States</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Good faith does NOT apply when:</strong></p>

      <li>The affidavit was so lacking in probable cause that no reasonable officer would rely on it.</li>
      <li>The magistrate was misled by affiant's knowing or reckless falsehoods. (<em>Franks v. Delaware</em>)</li>
      <li>The magistrate wholly abandoned the judicial role.</li>
      <li>The warrant is so facially deficient that officers could not reasonably presume it was valid.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Scope &amp; Limitations of the Exclusionary Rule</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Applies in:</strong> Prosecution's case-in-chief (criminal trial).</li>
      <li><strong>Does NOT apply in:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Grand jury proceedings (<em>United States v. Calandra</em>)</li>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <strong>California Distinction &mdash; Proposition 8 ("Truth-in-Evidence"):</strong> California's Proposition 8 (Cal. Const. Art. I, &sect;28(f)(2)) provides that "relevant evidence shall not be excluded in any criminal proceeding." This effectively <strong>abolishes independent state exclusionary protections</strong> and limits California to the <strong>federal constitutional minimum</strong> under the 4th Amendment. Before Prop. 8, California had broader exclusionary protections (e.g., <em>Brisendine</em> requiring Miranda-like warnings for consent searches). After Prop. 8, California follows federal exclusionary rule standards. Exception: Prop. 8 does not apply to privilege (attorney-client, etc.) or to specific statutory protections.

    <!-- ===== FIFTH AMENDMENT ===== -->
    <h2>III. The Fifth Amendment &mdash; Self-Incrimination &amp; Miranda</h2>

    <h3>A. Miranda Warnings &amp; Waiver</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em> (1966):</strong> Before <strong>custodial interrogation</strong>, officers must inform the suspect of: (1) the right to remain silent; (2) that anything said can be used in court; (3) the right to an attorney; and (4) the right to appointed counsel if indigent. A suspect may waive these rights only if the waiver is <strong>knowing, intelligent, and voluntary</strong>.
    </div>

    <h4>1. "Custody" &mdash; Would a Reasonable Person Feel Free to Leave?</h4>
    <p>The test is objective: would a <strong>reasonable person in the suspect's position</strong> feel they were in custody (i.e., deprived of freedom in a significant way)? (<em>Thompson v. Keohane</em>)</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Custody:</strong> Formal arrest; placed in police car; taken to station against will; locked in room.</li>
      <li><strong>NOT custody:</strong> Routine traffic stop (<em>Berkemer v. McCarty</em>); Terry stop (brief, temporary); voluntary interview at station where told "free to leave"; probation interview (<em>Minnesota v. Murphy</em>).</li>
      <li><strong>Age matters:</strong> A child's age is relevant to custody analysis if known or objectively apparent. (<em>J.D.B. v. North Carolina</em>, 2011)</li>
      <li><strong>Prison:</strong> Incarcerated person is not automatically "in custody" for Miranda &mdash; must look at whether additional restraint was imposed beyond normal prison conditions. (<em>Howes v. Fields</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. "Interrogation" &mdash; Express Questioning or Its Functional Equivalent</h4>
    <p>Interrogation includes express questioning AND any <strong>words or actions by police that are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response</strong>. (<em>Rhode Island v. Innis</em>)</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>IS interrogation:</strong> Direct questions about the crime; "Christian burial speech" (<em>Brewer v. Williams</em>); confronting suspect with damaging evidence to provoke a response.</li>
      <li><strong>NOT interrogation:</strong> Spontaneous/volunteered statements; routine booking questions (name, address, DOB) (<em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz</em>); statements to undercover officers or cellmates (<em>Illinois v. Perkins</em> &mdash; no coercive atmosphere); general on-scene questioning during emergency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Waiver of Miranda Rights</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Waiver must be <strong>knowing, intelligent, and voluntary</strong> under the totality of the circumstances.</li>
      <li><strong>Express waiver:</strong> Suspect explicitly agrees to talk.</li>
      <li><strong>Implied waiver:</strong> Suspect is read rights, acknowledges understanding, then begins answering questions. (<em>Berghuis v. Thompkins</em>, 2010 &mdash; defendant remained mostly silent for 2.75 hours, then answered one question; waiver found.)</li>
      <li>Police <strong>deception about the subject matter</strong> does not necessarily invalidate waiver, but it is a factor. (<em>Colorado v. Spring</em>)</li>
      <li>Failure to inform suspect of <strong>attorney's attempt to reach them</strong> does not invalidate waiver. (<em>Moran v. Burbine</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Invocation of Rights</h4>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Right Invoked</th><th>Standard</th><th>Police Obligations</th><th>Resumption</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Right to Silence</strong></td>
          <td>Must be <strong>unambiguous</strong> (<em>Berghuis v. Thompkins</em>)</td>
          <td>Must "scrupulously honor" &mdash; stop questioning</td>
          <td>Police may re-approach after a significant time has passed, re-Mirandize, and question about a <strong>different crime</strong>. (<em>Michigan v. Mosley</em>)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Right to Counsel</strong></td>
          <td>Must be <strong>unambiguous and unequivocal</strong> (<em>Davis v. United States</em> &mdash; "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer" is insufficient)</td>
          <td>Must <strong>immediately</strong> cease all interrogation</td>
          <td>Police may NOT reinitiate questioning about <strong>any crime</strong> until counsel is provided or the suspect reinitiates communication. (<em>Edwards v. Arizona</em>) After 14-day break in custody, police may re-approach. (<em>Maryland v. Shatzer</em>, 2010)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout-warning">
      <strong>Critical Distinction &mdash; Invoking Silence vs. Counsel:</strong> Invoking the right to silence is crime-specific and allows re-approach after a cooling-off period on a <em>different crime</em>. Invoking the right to counsel is broader &mdash; it bars ALL interrogation on ANY topic unless counsel is present or the suspect reinitiates. This is a favorite bar exam testing point.
    </div>

    <h4>5. Exceptions to Miranda</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Public Safety Exception &mdash; <em>New York v. Quarles</em> (1984):</strong> Officers may ask questions <strong>reasonably prompted by concern for public safety</strong> without Miranda warnings (e.g., "Where's the gun?"). Answers and physical evidence are admissible.</li>
      <li><strong>Routine Booking Exception:</strong> Biographical data questions (name, address, DOB) are not interrogation. (<em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Undercover Agent Exception &mdash; <em>Illinois v. Perkins</em>:</strong> Miranda does not apply when suspect is unaware they are speaking to law enforcement (no coercive atmosphere).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>6. Remedy for Miranda Violations</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Statements obtained in violation of Miranda:</strong> Inadmissible in the prosecution's <strong>case-in-chief</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Impeachment:</strong> Statements taken in violation of Miranda (but not coerced) may be used to <strong>impeach the defendant's trial testimony</strong>. (<em>Harris v. New York</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Physical evidence:</strong> Physical fruits of unwarned (but voluntary) statements are generally admissible. (<em>United States v. Patane</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Subsequent warned statement:</strong> If police obtain an initial unwarned statement, then give warnings and obtain a second statement, the second statement may be suppressed if the question-first technique was deliberate. (<em>Missouri v. Seibert</em> &mdash; two-step interrogation designed to undermine Miranda; BUT <em>Oregon v. Elstad</em> &mdash; initial Miranda failure was inadvertent, so subsequent warned statement was admissible.)</li>
      <li><strong>Truly involuntary/coerced statements</strong> (due process violation) may NOT be used for any purpose, including impeachment. (<em>Mincey v. Arizona</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Miranda is a constitutional rule:</strong> (<em>Dickerson v. United States</em>, 2000) BUT violation of Miranda does not create a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. &sect;1983. (<em>Vega v. Tekoh</em>, 2022)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule:</strong> The 5th Amendment provides that no person "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." This protects against compelled <strong>testimonial or communicative</strong> evidence, not physical evidence.
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Testimonial/communicative:</strong> Oral statements, written statements, compelled production of documents revealing contents of one's mind. The <strong>act of production</strong> itself can be testimonial (admitting existence, possession, authenticity). (<em>Fisher v. United States; United States v. Hubbell</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>NOT testimonial (no 5th Amendment protection):</strong> Blood samples, DNA, handwriting exemplars, voice exemplars, hair samples, standing in lineup, field sobriety tests (physical), breathalyzer.</li>
      <li><strong>Who can invoke:</strong> Natural persons only (not corporations or other entities). (<em>Braswell v. United States</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>When invocable:</strong> In any proceeding (criminal, civil, administrative, legislative) where the answer might incriminate. At trial, the defendant's decision not to testify cannot be commented upon by the prosecution. (<em>Griffin v. California</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Immunity:</strong> Government may compel testimony by granting <strong>use and derivative use immunity</strong> (testimony and its fruits cannot be used against the witness). Transactional immunity (complete immunity from prosecution for the transaction) is broader but not constitutionally required. (<em>Kastigar v. United States</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Double Jeopardy</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule:</strong> The 5th Amendment provides that no person shall "be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." This protects against: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after <strong>acquittal</strong>; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after <strong>conviction</strong>; and (3) <strong>multiple punishments</strong> for the same offense in a single trial (beyond legislative intent).
    </div>

    <h4>1. When Jeopardy Attaches</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Jury trial:</strong> When the jury is <strong>empaneled and sworn</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Bench trial:</strong> When the first <strong>witness is sworn</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Guilty plea:</strong> When the plea is <strong>accepted by the court</strong>.</li>
      <li>Jeopardy does NOT attach at indictment, arraignment, or preliminary hearing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. "Same Offense" &mdash; The Blockburger Test</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Blockburger v. United States</em> (1932):</strong> Two offenses are the "same offense" for double jeopardy purposes unless each offense requires proof of an element that the other does not. If each requires a unique element, they are different offenses and separate prosecutions/punishments are permitted.
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Lesser included offenses:</strong> A lesser included offense is the "same offense" as the greater &mdash; prosecution for one bars prosecution for the other. (e.g., robbery includes assault; manslaughter included in murder.)</li>
      <li><strong>Greater offense committed after prosecution for lesser:</strong> If new facts arise (e.g., victim dies after assault conviction), some courts allow prosecution for the greater offense. (<em>Diaz v. United States</em>, 2024)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Exceptions / When Retrial Is Permitted</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Mistrial at defendant's request/consent</strong> (unless government intended to provoke it &mdash; <em>Oregon v. Kennedy</em>).</li>
      <li><strong>Hung jury</strong> &mdash; retrial permitted.</li>
      <li><strong>Successful appeal by defendant</strong> &mdash; conviction reversed on appeal, retrial permitted (defendant "waived" protection by seeking reversal). Exception: reversal based on <em>insufficient evidence</em> bars retrial. (<em>Burks v. United States</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Separate sovereigns doctrine:</strong> Federal and state governments are separate sovereigns &mdash; both may prosecute for the same conduct without violating double jeopardy. (<em>Gamble v. United States</em>, 2019) Same applies to different states.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <strong>California Distinction &mdash; Kellett Rule:</strong> California's <em>Kellett v. Superior Court</em> (1966) goes beyond federal double jeopardy by requiring that the prosecution bring <strong>all charges arising from the same act or course of conduct</strong> in a single proceeding. Failure to do so may bar subsequent prosecution even if the offenses are different under <em>Blockburger</em>. This is a compulsory joinder rule unique to California.
    </div>

    <!-- ===== SIXTH AMENDMENT ===== -->
    <h2>IV. The Sixth Amendment</h2>

    <h3>A. Right to Counsel</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule:</strong> The 6th Amendment guarantees the right to counsel in all <strong>criminal prosecutions</strong>. This right attaches at the initiation of <strong>adversary judicial proceedings</strong> (formal charge, indictment, information, arraignment, preliminary hearing). (<em>Rothgery v. Gillespie County</em>; <em>Kirby v. Illinois</em>)
    </div>

        <tr><td><strong>Trigger for violation</strong></td><td>Custodial interrogation without warnings or after invocation</td><td>Deliberate elicitation of statements about charged offense without counsel. (<em>Massiah v. United States; Brewer v. Williams</em>)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Undercover agents</strong></td><td>No violation &mdash; no coercive atmosphere (<em>Perkins</em>)</td><td><strong>Violation</strong> if agent deliberately elicits statements about charged offense. (<em>United States v. Henry; Kuhlmann v. Wilson</em> &mdash; passive "listening post" OK, but active elicitation violates.)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Waiver</strong></td><td>Knowing, voluntary, intelligent</td><td>Knowing, voluntary, intelligent &mdash; but <strong>police-initiated</strong> interrogation after invocation is invalid unless counsel present. (<em>Michigan v. Jackson</em> &mdash; NOTE: overruled by <em>Montejo v. Louisiana</em> &mdash; police may approach 6th Amendment defendant who has not affirmatively requested counsel.)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout-warning">
      <strong>Key Testing Point &mdash; Offense-Specific Nature of 6th Amendment:</strong> The 6th Amendment right to counsel is <strong>offense-specific</strong>. If D is charged with robbery and police question D about an uncharged murder (without counsel), the 6th Amendment is not violated (though Miranda still applies if D is in custody). "Offense" is construed narrowly &mdash; offenses must be the same under <em>Blockburger</em>. (<em>Texas v. Cobb</em>)
    </div>

    <h4>Effective Assistance of Counsel &mdash; <em>Strickland v. Washington</em></h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Two-prong test:</strong> (1) <strong>Deficient performance</strong> &mdash; counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; AND (2) <strong>Prejudice</strong> &mdash; reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</li>
      <li><strong>Presumption of competence</strong> &mdash; great deference to counsel's strategic choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Prejudice presumed</strong> in certain situations: actual conflict of interest adversely affecting representation (<em>Cuyler v. Sullivan</em>); complete denial of counsel at a critical stage; state interference with counsel.</li>
      <li><strong>Guilty pleas &mdash; <em>Hill v. Lockhart; Lafler v. Cooper; Missouri v. Frye</em>:</strong> Ineffective assistance applies to plea bargaining. Prejudice = reasonable probability defendant would have accepted (or received) a better plea offer but for counsel's errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Right to Jury Trial</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Attaches for offenses carrying <strong>more than 6 months' imprisonment</strong>. (<em>Baldwin v. New York</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Federal:</strong> 12-person jury; unanimous verdict required. (<em>Ramos v. Louisiana</em>, 2020 &mdash; unanimity requirement applies to states.)</li>
      <li><strong>State:</strong> Minimum 6 jurors. (<em>Williams v. Florida</em>) If only 6, verdict must be unanimous. (<em>Burch v. Louisiana</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-section requirement:</strong> Jury venire (pool) must represent a fair cross-section of the community. (<em>Taylor v. Louisiana</em>) BUT the <em>petit jury</em> itself need not be representative.</li>
      <li><strong>Peremptory challenges &mdash; <em>Batson v. Kentucky</em>:</strong> Prosecutor may not use peremptory challenges to exclude jurors based on race (or gender &mdash; <em>J.E.B. v. Alabama</em>). Three-step process: (1) prima facie case of discrimination; (2) race-neutral explanation; (3) court determines pretext.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Right to Speedy Trial</h3>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Barker v. Wingo</em> (1972):</strong> Courts use a four-factor balancing test: (1) <strong>length of delay</strong> (threshold trigger &mdash; must be "presumptively prejudicial"); (2) <strong>reason for the delay</strong> (deliberate delay by prosecution weighs heavily; negligence weighs less; valid reasons like missing witnesses weigh for government); (3) <strong>defendant's assertion</strong> of the right; (4) <strong>prejudice</strong> to the defendant (impaired defense, oppressive pretrial incarceration, anxiety).
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> <strong>Dismissal with prejudice</strong> (the only remedy &mdash; cannot be retried).</li>
      <li><strong>Attaches:</strong> At arrest or formal charge (whichever is earlier). Does NOT apply to pre-accusation delay (pre-indictment delay analyzed under Due Process).</li>
      <li><strong>Federal Speedy Trial Act:</strong> Generally requires trial within 70 days of indictment or initial appearance (whichever is later). Certain delays are excludable (e.g., continuances, pretrial motions).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Confrontation Clause &mdash; <em>Crawford v. Washington</em></h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Crawford v. Washington</em> (2004):</strong> The Confrontation Clause bars admission of <strong>testimonial statements</strong> by a declarant who does not testify at trial, unless the declarant is <strong>unavailable</strong> and the defendant had a <strong>prior opportunity to cross-examine</strong>.
    </div>

    <h4>What Is "Testimonial"?</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Testimonial:</strong> Prior testimony at preliminary hearing, before grand jury, or at former trial; statements made during police interrogation when the <strong>primary purpose</strong> is to establish or prove past events relevant to later prosecution. (<em>Davis v. Washington; Michigan v. Bryant</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Non-testimonial:</strong> Statements made during an ongoing emergency (e.g., 911 call reporting ongoing violence &mdash; <em>Davis</em>); business records made in the ordinary course; casual remarks to friends; co-conspirator statements during and in furtherance of conspiracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Forensic reports &mdash; <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts; Bullcoming v. New Mexico</em>:</strong> Lab reports/certificates prepared for use in prosecution are testimonial &mdash; analyst must testify. A surrogate analyst is insufficient unless the testifying witness conducted an independent review. (<em>Williams v. Illinois</em> &mdash; plurality, fractured opinion.)</li>
    </ul>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Confrontation Clause vs. Hearsay Rules &mdash; What's the Difference?</strong></summary>
      <p>The Confrontation Clause is a <em>constitutional</em> limitation on the use of out-of-court statements, while hearsay rules are <em>evidentiary</em> rules. Even if a statement falls within a hearsay exception (e.g., dying declaration, excited utterance), it may still be barred by the Confrontation Clause if it is <strong>testimonial</strong> and the declarant is unavailable without prior opportunity for cross-examination. However, the Supreme Court has hinted that dying declarations may be a historical exception to the Confrontation Clause. Non-testimonial statements are governed solely by hearsay rules, not by <em>Crawford</em>.</p>

    <h3>B. Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel at Identifications</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Post-charge lineups and showups:</strong> Defendant has a right to have counsel present. (<em>United States v. Wade; Gilbert v. California</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-charge lineups:</strong> No right to counsel &mdash; 6th Amendment has not yet attached. (<em>Kirby v. Illinois</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Photo arrays:</strong> No right to counsel at <em>any</em> stage because it is not a "critical stage" requiring counsel's presence. (<em>United States v. Ash</em>)</li>

    <h3>C. Due Process Challenge &mdash; <em>Manson v. Brathwaite</em></h3>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule:</strong> An identification procedure violates due process if it is (1) <strong>unnecessarily suggestive</strong> AND (2) creates a substantial likelihood of <strong>irreparable misidentification</strong>, considering the totality of the circumstances.

      <li>Bail may be denied if the defendant poses a <strong>danger to the community</strong> or a serious <strong>flight risk</strong>. (<em>United States v. Salerno</em>)</li>

      <li><strong>Federal:</strong> 5th Amendment requires grand jury indictment for all federal felonies.</li>
      <li><strong>States:</strong> Grand jury indictment is <strong>NOT required</strong> &mdash; the 5th Amendment Grand Jury Clause has NOT been incorporated against the states. (<em>Hurtado v. California</em>) States may proceed by information filed by the prosecutor.</li>
      <li><strong>Grand jury proceedings:</strong> Secret; no right to counsel inside the grand jury room; rules of evidence do not apply; no right to present exculpatory evidence; no right to confront witnesses. Prosecutor has wide discretion.</li>

      <li>6th Amendment right to counsel is triggered at arraignment. (<em>Rothgery v. Gillespie County</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>E. Prosecutorial Duty to Disclose &mdash; <em>Brady v. Maryland</em></h3>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Brady v. Maryland</em> (1963):</strong> The prosecution must disclose <strong>material exculpatory evidence</strong> to the defense. Evidence is "material" if there is a <strong>reasonable probability</strong> that disclosure would have changed the outcome of the proceeding. This includes impeachment evidence. (<em>Giglio v. United States</em>)
    </div>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Applies to evidence known to the prosecution or in the possession of the police team.</li>
      <li>Applies regardless of good or bad faith of the prosecution.</li>
      <li>Failure to disclose = due process violation; remedy is typically a new trial.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== TRIAL RIGHTS ===== -->
    <h2>VII. Trial Rights</h2>

    <h3>A. Right to a Public Trial</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>6th Amendment guarantees a public trial. Closure requires: (1) overriding interest; (2) closure is narrowly tailored; (3) alternatives considered; (4) findings on the record. (<em>Waller v. Georgia</em>)</li>
      <li>The public and press also have a 1st Amendment right of access to criminal trials. (<em>Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Right to Compulsory Process</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>6th Amendment right to use subpoena power to compel attendance of favorable witnesses.</li>
      <li>Government may not arbitrarily prevent defense witnesses from testifying. (<em>Washington v. Texas</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Due Process Rights at Trial</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Presumption of innocence</strong> and <strong>proof beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> for every element. (<em>In re Winship</em>)</li>
      <li>Right to be present at trial (may be waived by voluntary absence or disruptive conduct &mdash; <em>Illinois v. Allen</em>).</li>
      <li>Right to testify on one's own behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>No comment on silence:</strong> Prosecutor may not comment on defendant's failure to testify. (<em>Griffin v. California</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== GUILTY PLEAS ===== -->
    <h2>VIII. Guilty Pleas</h2>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <strong>Rule &mdash; <em>Boykin v. Alabama</em> (1969):</strong> A guilty plea must be <strong>knowing, intelligent, and voluntary</strong>. The record must show the defendant was informed of and understood the rights being waived: (1) right to jury trial; (2) right to confront witnesses; (3) privilege against self-incrimination.
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Factual basis:</strong> Federal Rule 11 (and most states) requires a factual basis for the plea.</li>
      <li><strong>Plea bargaining:</strong> Constitutionally permissible. (<em>Brady v. United States</em>) Prosecutor may threaten additional charges to induce plea if charges are supportable. (<em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Broken plea agreements:</strong> If the prosecution breaches a plea agreement, the defendant is entitled to specific performance or withdrawal of the plea. (<em>Santobello v. New York</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> Before sentencing &mdash; generally allowed for "fair and just reason." After sentencing &mdash; very limited (must show manifest injustice or involuntariness).</li>
      <li><strong>Conditional guilty plea:</strong> Defendant may plead guilty while preserving the right to appeal a pretrial ruling (e.g., denial of motion to suppress).</li>
      <li><strong>Effect on claims:</strong> A voluntary guilty plea waives most pre-plea constitutional defects (e.g., illegal search, Miranda violation) except jurisdictional defects and challenges to the voluntariness of the plea itself. (<em>Tollett v. Henderson</em>)</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== SENTENCING ===== -->
    <h2>IX. Sentencing</h2>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong><em>Apprendi v. New Jersey</em> (2000) / <em>Blakely v. Washington</em> (2004):</strong> Any fact (other than a prior conviction) that increases the <strong>maximum sentence</strong> beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</li>
      <li><strong><em>United States v. Booker</em> (2005):</strong> Federal Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, not mandatory.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Alleyne v. United States</em> (2013):</strong> Facts increasing mandatory <em>minimum</em> sentences must also be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</li>
      <li><strong>Death penalty &mdash; <em>Ring v. Arizona</em>:</strong> Aggravating factors making defendant eligible for death must be found by jury.</li>
      <li><strong>8th Amendment:</strong> No cruel and unusual punishment. Proportionality review applies (especially in capital cases and LWOP for juveniles).</li>
      <li><strong>Juvenile sentencing:</strong> LWOP for non-homicide offenses unconstitutional (<em>Graham v. Florida</em>); mandatory LWOP for any juvenile offense unconstitutional (<em>Miller v. Alabama</em>); <em>Miller</em> applies retroactively (<em>Montgomery v. Louisiana</em>).</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== APPEALS & HABEAS ===== -->
    <h2>X. Appeals &amp; Habeas Corpus</h2>

    <h3>A. Appeals</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>No constitutional right</strong> to an appeal, but once a state provides appellate review, due process and equal protection apply.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to counsel on first appeal as of right.</strong> (<em>Douglas v. California</em>) No right to counsel on discretionary appeals. (<em>Ross v. Moffitt</em>)</li>
      <li><strong>Harmless error:</strong> Constitutional errors may be deemed harmless if the government proves <strong>beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> that the error did not contribute to the verdict. (<em>Chapman v. California</em>) Some errors are <strong>structural</strong> and never harmless (e.g., denial of counsel, biased judge, denial of self-representation, denial of public trial).</li>
      <li><strong>Plain error:</strong> Errors not objected to at trial are reviewed under the plain error standard (error that is clear, affects substantial rights, and seriously affects the fairness/integrity of proceedings).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Habeas Corpus</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Federal habeas corpus</strong> (28 U.S.C. &sect;2254) allows state prisoners to challenge their convictions in federal court on grounds that custody violates the Constitution.</li>
      <li><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> Must exhaust state remedies first.</li>
      <li><strong>AEDPA standard:</strong> Federal courts grant habeas relief only if the state court decision was (1) <strong>contrary to</strong> or an <strong>unreasonable application of</strong> clearly established Supreme Court precedent, or (2) based on an <strong>unreasonable determination of facts</strong>. Very deferential standard.</li>
      <li><strong>Procedural default:</strong> If defendant failed to raise a claim in state court due to procedural default, federal habeas review is barred unless defendant shows (1) cause for the default and prejudice, or (2) actual innocence.</li>
      <li><strong>Retroactivity &mdash; <em>Teague v. Lane</em>:</strong> New rules of criminal procedure generally do NOT apply retroactively to cases on habeas review, with two exceptions: (1) substantive rules (decriminalization or rules placing conduct beyond government's power to punish); (2) watershed procedural rules (effectively defunct category).</li>
    </ul>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Proposition 8 &mdash; Deep Dive</strong></summary>
      <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Cal. Const. Art. I, &sect;28(f)(2) provides: "Except as provided by statute hereafter enacted by a two-thirds vote of the membership in each house of the Legislature, relevant evidence shall not be excluded in any criminal proceeding." This effectively means that California courts cannot use the state constitution to create exclusionary protections broader than those required by the federal Constitution.</p>
      <p><strong>What it does NOT do:</strong> Prop 8 does not affect: (1) statutory privileges (attorney-client, physician-patient, etc.); (2) evidence code provisions enacted by two-thirds legislative vote; (3) constitutional rights that do not involve the exclusionary rule (e.g., the right to privacy for non-exclusionary purposes); (4) protections that are co-extensive with federal protections.</p>
      <p><strong>Practical effect on essays:</strong> When analyzing a search and seizure issue on a CA bar essay, apply federal 4th Amendment standards. If the search/seizure is valid under federal law, it is valid under California law (post-Prop 8). If the search/seizure violates the federal 4th Amendment, the evidence is excluded under both federal and California law. There is generally no separate California analysis that would produce a different result for exclusionary rule purposes.</p>

    <!-- ===== COMMON ESSAY PATTERNS ===== -->
    <h2>Common Essay Patterns</h2>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>How Criminal Procedure Appears on the Bar:</strong> Crim Pro essays frequently combine multiple constitutional amendments in a single fact pattern. A typical essay might involve: a stop and frisk, leading to an arrest, leading to a search incident to arrest, leading to an interrogation at the station. You must analyze each stage separately under the applicable amendment.
    </div>

    <h3>Pattern 1: The Multi-Stage Investigation</h3>
    <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Police receive a tip, conduct surveillance, perform a traffic stop, discover evidence, arrest the suspect, search the car and cell phone, and interrogate at the station.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues to address:</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Was the tip sufficient for reasonable suspicion? Probable cause? (<em>Gates</em> totality test)</li>
      <li>Was the stop valid under <em>Terry</em>? Was it improperly extended? (<em>Rodriguez</em>)</li>
      <li>Was the arrest supported by probable cause?</li>
      <li>Was the vehicle search valid? (Automobile exception vs. SILA under <em>Gant</em>)</li>
      <li>Cell phone search &mdash; warrant required under <em>Riley</em></li>
      <li>Were Miranda warnings given before custodial interrogation?</li>
      <li>Did defendant invoke rights? Was invocation honored?</li>
      <li>Exclusionary rule &mdash; fruit of the poisonous tree analysis for each item</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pattern 2: Home Entry &amp; Consent Issues</h3>
    <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Police go to suspect's home, obtain consent from a roommate, search the house, find evidence, arrest the suspect, and question them.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues to address:</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Standing of defendant to challenge the search</li>
      <li>Third-party consent &mdash; actual vs. apparent authority</li>
      <li>Co-occupant objection rule (<em>Randolph</em> / <em>Fernandez</em>)</li>
      <li>Scope of consent</li>
      <li>If no valid consent: was there an exigent circumstance? Plain view?</li>
      <li>Post-arrest Miranda analysis</li>
      <li>CA distinction: Prop 8 &mdash; federal standard controls exclusion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pattern 3: Identification &amp; Right to Counsel</h3>
    <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Witness views a showup or lineup; defendant is charged; police later question defendant without counsel about the charged offense and an uncharged offense.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues to address:</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Was the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive? (<em>Manson v. Brathwaite</em>)</li>
      <li>Was there a right to counsel at the identification? (Post-charge lineup: yes; photo array: no)</li>
      <li>6th Amendment right to counsel: has it attached? Offense-specific analysis. (<em>Massiah</em>; <em>Texas v. Cobb</em>)</li>
      <li>5th Amendment Miranda: was there custodial interrogation on the uncharged offense?</li>
      <li>Distinguish 5th vs. 6th Amendment counsel rights (scope, trigger, invocation effects)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pattern 4: Double Jeopardy &amp; Guilty Pleas</h3>
    <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Defendant is prosecuted, enters a plea or goes to trial, then faces a second prosecution for a related offense.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues to address:</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Has jeopardy attached? (When?)</li>
      <li><em>Blockburger</em> same-offense test</li>
      <li>Lesser included offense analysis</li>
      <li>Separate sovereigns doctrine</li>
      <li>If guilty plea: was it knowing, intelligent, voluntary? (<em>Boykin</em>)</li>
      <li>Effectiveness of counsel in plea bargaining (<em>Lafler; Frye</em>)</li>
      <li>CA: <em>Kellett</em> compulsory joinder rule</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pattern 5: Trial Rights &amp; Post-Trial</h3>
    <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Errors occur at trial (Confrontation Clause violations, jury selection issues, sentencing enhancements), and defendant seeks appellate or habeas relief.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues to address:</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Confrontation Clause: was the out-of-court statement testimonial? (<em>Crawford</em>)</li>
      <li><em>Batson</em> challenge to peremptory strikes</li>
      <li><em>Apprendi</em>/<em>Blakely</em>: were sentencing facts found by jury beyond reasonable doubt?</li>
      <li>Ineffective assistance of counsel (<em>Strickland</em> two-prong test)</li>
      <li>Harmless error vs. structural error analysis</li>
      <li>Habeas: exhaustion, AEDPA standard, procedural default</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== ISSUE SPOTTING CHECKLIST ===== -->
    <h2>Issue-Spotting Checklist</h2>

    <ul class="checklist">
      <li><strong>4th Amendment &mdash; Search:</strong> Was government conduct a "search"? Apply REP (<em>Katz</em>) and trespass (<em>Jones</em>) tests. Did defendant have standing?</li>
      <li><strong>4th Amendment &mdash; Warrant:</strong> Was there a warrant? Was it valid (PC, neutral magistrate, particularity)? Was it properly executed?</li>
      <li><strong>4th Amendment &mdash; Exception:</strong> If no warrant, does an exception apply? (SILA, automobile, plain view, consent, Terry, exigent, inventory, border, special needs)</li>
      <li><strong>Exclusionary Rule:</strong> If the search/seizure was illegal, is evidence excluded? Any exception? (Good faith, independent source, inevitable discovery, attenuation)</li>
      <li><strong>5th Amendment &mdash; Miranda:</strong> Was there custodial interrogation? Were warnings given? Was there a valid waiver? Did defendant invoke? Was invocation honored? Any exception (public safety, booking, undercover)?</li>
      <li><strong>5th Amendment &mdash; Self-Incrimination:</strong> Is the evidence testimonial? Was it compelled? Immunity issues?</li>
      <li><strong>5th Amendment &mdash; Double Jeopardy:</strong> Has jeopardy attached? Same offense under <em>Blockburger</em>? Any exception (mistrial, appeal, separate sovereigns)?</li>
      <li><strong>6th Amendment &mdash; Right to Counsel:</strong> Have adversary proceedings begun? Is the right offense-specific? <em>Massiah</em> deliberate elicitation? Effective assistance (<em>Strickland</em>)?</li>
      <li><strong>6th Amendment &mdash; Jury Trial:</strong> Offense punishable by &gt;6 months? Proper jury size and unanimity? <em>Batson</em> issues?</li>
      <li><strong>6th Amendment &mdash; Speedy Trial:</strong> <em>Barker</em> factors? CA Penal Code &sect;1382?</li>
      <li><strong>6th Amendment &mdash; Confrontation:</strong> Testimonial hearsay under <em>Crawford</em>? Unavailability + prior cross-examination?</li>
      <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Suggestive procedure? <em>Manson v. Brathwaite</em> reliability? Right to counsel at lineup?</li>
      <li><strong>Pretrial:</strong> Bail (excessive?), grand jury (required?), preliminary hearing (PC?), <em>Brady</em> disclosure?</li>
      <li><strong>Guilty Plea:</strong> Knowing, intelligent, voluntary? <em>Boykin</em> colloquy? Plea bargain enforced?</li>
      <li><strong>Sentencing:</strong> <em>Apprendi</em>/<em>Blakely</em> &mdash; jury finding for facts increasing maximum? 8th Amendment proportionality?</li>
      <li><strong>CA Distinctions:</strong> Prop 8 (exclusionary rule), <em>Kellett</em> (joinder), two-party consent, speedy trial (PC &sect;1382), independent state grounds?</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== EXAM TIPS ===== -->
    <h2>Exam Tips</h2>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Tip 1: Follow the Chronology.</strong> Organize your essay answer in the order events occurred: investigation, arrest, interrogation, identification, pretrial, trial, post-trial. This ensures you catch every issue and provides a logical structure graders expect.
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Tip 2: Always State the Standard.</strong> For every constitutional issue, explicitly state the standard. "Under the 4th Amendment, a search occurs when..." "Miranda warnings are required when there is custodial interrogation, meaning..." This earns points even if your application is imperfect.
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Tip 3: Distinguish 5th vs. 6th Amendment Counsel.</strong> This is a perennial bar favorite. Always address BOTH when counsel issues arise. Note the different triggers (custody vs. charging), different scopes (all crimes vs. offense-specific), and different rules for undercover agents.
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Tip 4: Address the Exclusionary Rule for EVERY Violation.</strong> After finding a constitutional violation, discuss the remedy. State the exclusionary rule, discuss fruit of the poisonous tree, and analyze whether any exception applies (good faith, attenuation, inevitable discovery, independent source). Also note where the rule does NOT apply (grand jury, impeachment, etc.).
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Tip 5: Do Not Forget California.</strong> On essay questions, after completing the federal analysis, add a California section. At minimum, note: (1) Prop 8 means CA follows federal exclusionary rule standards; (2) <em>Kellett</em> compulsory joinder; (3) CA speedy trial rules (PC &sect;1382); (4) two-party consent for recordings. Even a brief mention earns points.
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Tip 6: Standing First.</strong> Before analyzing whether a search was unconstitutional, confirm the defendant has standing. If D is challenging a search of someone else's property and lacks a sufficient connection (overnight guest, etc.), the analysis may end there.
    </div>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <strong>Tip 7: MBE Strategy.</strong> On MBE questions, pay close attention to: (a) whether the question asks what the court "should" do vs. what the "best argument" is; (b) whether the issue is standing, the constitutional violation itself, or the remedy; (c) the distinction between "reasonable suspicion" and "probable cause" standards. Many wrong answers use the correct rule but the wrong standard of proof.
