    <h1>Business Associations</h1>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">High-Yield Subject</div>
      Business Associations is tested regularly on the California Bar Exam, appearing both as full essay questions and as crossover issues with Remedies, Professional Responsibility, and Community Property. Agency principles, fiduciary duties, and piercing the corporate veil are the three most frequently tested topics. Master these first, then build outward.
    </div>

    <p>Business Associations encompasses the law governing the formation, operation, governance, and dissolution of business entities, as well as the agency relationships that underlie all of them. The California Bar draws from the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA), the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA), California Corporations Code, the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (RULLCA), and the Restatement (Third) of Agency.</p>

    <p>For exam purposes, the subject breaks into five major clusters:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Agency</strong> &mdash; Formation, types of authority, liability of principals and agents, duties owed</li>
        <li><strong>Partnerships</strong> &mdash; General partnerships, limited partnerships, LLPs; formation, management, liability, dissociation, dissolution</li>
        <li><strong>Corporations</strong> &mdash; Formation, governance, fiduciary duties, shareholder rights, fundamental changes, piercing the veil</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)</strong> &mdash; Formation, operating agreements, management, fiduciary duties, dissolution</li>
        <li><strong>Securities Basics</strong> &mdash; Registration requirements, exemptions, anti-fraud provisions, insider trading</li>
      </ol>

    <!--  I. AGENCY LAW                                                 -->
    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <h2>I. Agency Law</h2>

    <p>Agency is the foundational relationship in all of business associations. Every partnership, corporation, and LLC operates through agents. Understanding agency law is prerequisite to understanding everything else in this subject.</p>

    <h3>A. Formation of the Agency Relationship</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Agency Defined</div>
      An agency relationship arises when one person (the <strong>principal</strong>) manifests assent that another person (the <strong>agent</strong>) shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents to so act. <em>Restatement (Third) of Agency &sect; 1.01.</em>
    </div>

    <p>Key requirements for formation:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong> &mdash; Both principal and agent must consent to the relationship. No formal agreement is required; consent can be implied from conduct.</li>
        <li><strong>Control</strong> &mdash; The principal must have the right to control the agent's conduct. This distinguishes agency from other relationships (e.g., buyer-seller).</li>
        <li><strong>On Behalf Of</strong> &mdash; The agent must be acting on the principal's behalf, not solely for the agent's own benefit.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p><strong>No consideration required.</strong> Agency is a consensual relationship, not a contractual one. Gratuitous agents owe the same duties as compensated agents once they begin performance.</p>

    <p><strong>No writing required.</strong> Agency can be created orally or by conduct, with one exception: under the <strong>equal dignities rule</strong>, if the underlying transaction must be in writing (e.g., a contract within the Statute of Frauds), the agency authorization must also be in writing.</p>

    <h3>B. Types of Authority</h3>

    <p>The central question in most agency problems is: <em>Did the agent have authority to bind the principal?</em> There are several types of authority, and they often overlap.</p>

    <h4>1. Actual Authority (Express and Implied)</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Actual Authority</div>
      An agent has actual authority when, at the time of taking action, the agent reasonably believes, in accordance with the principal's manifestations to the agent, that the principal wishes the agent to so act. <em>Restatement (Third) of Agency &sect; 2.01.</em>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Express actual authority</strong> arises from the principal's explicit instructions to the agent. Example: "Go buy 100 shares of XYZ stock on my behalf."</p>

    <p><strong>Implied actual authority</strong> arises from conduct, custom, or the nature of the agent's position. It includes authority to do what is reasonably necessary to carry out expressly authorized tasks, authority implied by custom or trade usage, and authority implied by the agent's position or title.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
      Always analyze actual authority first. If the agent has actual authority, the principal is bound regardless of whether apparent authority also exists. Start with express, then check implied.
    </div>

    <h4>2. Apparent Authority</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Apparent Authority</div>
      Apparent authority exists when a third party reasonably believes the agent has authority to act on behalf of the principal, and that belief is traceable to the principal's own manifestations. <em>Restatement (Third) of Agency &sect; 2.03.</em>
    </div>

    <p>Key points about apparent authority:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The manifestation must come from the <strong>principal</strong>, not the agent. An agent cannot create their own apparent authority.</li>
      <li>The third party's belief must be <strong>reasonable</strong>.</li>
      <li>Common sources of apparent authority include: giving someone a title (e.g., "Vice President"), placing someone in a position that customarily carries certain authority, prior dealings where the principal allowed the agent to act similarly, and the principal's failure to notify third parties that an agent's actual authority has been revoked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Inherent Authority (Agency Power)</h4>

    <p>Under the Restatement (Second), inherent authority allowed a general agent to bind the principal even without actual or apparent authority, based on the agency relationship itself. The Restatement (Third) largely replaced this concept with refined rules on apparent authority and the doctrine of <strong>undisclosed principals</strong>. However, many jurisdictions (and bar exams) still recognize inherent authority as a distinct category.</p>

    <p>Inherent authority is most relevant when the principal is <strong>undisclosed</strong> (the third party does not know an agency exists) or <strong>partially disclosed</strong> (the third party knows there is a principal but not the principal's identity). In these situations, apparent authority cannot apply because the third party has no manifestation from the principal to rely on. Inherent authority fills this gap for general agents acting within the usual scope of their authority.</p>

    <h4>4. Ratification</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Ratification</div>
      Ratification occurs when a principal affirms a prior act done by an agent (or purported agent) who acted without authority. Ratification relates back to the time of the original act and binds the principal as if the agent had been authorized from the start. <em>Restatement (Third) of Agency &sect; 4.01.</em>
    </div>

    <p>Requirements for effective ratification:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li>The agent must have purported to act on behalf of the principal (not on the agent's own behalf).</li>
        <li>The principal must have <strong>knowledge</strong> of the material facts of the transaction at the time of ratification (or at least be aware that material facts may exist and choose to ratify anyway).</li>
        <li>The principal must affirm the <strong>entire transaction</strong> &mdash; partial ratification is not permitted.</li>
        <li>The principal must have had <strong>capacity</strong> to authorize the act at the time it was performed and at the time of ratification.</li>
        <li>Ratification must occur before the third party <strong>withdraws</strong> from the transaction.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>Ratification can be express or implied from conduct (e.g., accepting benefits of the unauthorized transaction, failing to repudiate within a reasonable time after learning of it, or suing to enforce the contract).</p>

    <h4>5. Estoppel</h4>

    <p><strong>Agency by estoppel</strong> arises when a principal's conduct (or failure to act) leads a third party to reasonably believe that an agent has authority, and the third party detrimentally relies on that belief. Unlike apparent authority, estoppel may arise from the principal's inaction (failure to correct a known misrepresentation). The remedy is typically limited to the third party's reliance damages rather than full enforcement of the transaction.</p>

    <h3>C. Liability in Agency</h3>

    <h4>1. Disclosed, Partially Disclosed, and Undisclosed Principals</h4>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Type of Principal</th>
          <th>Definition</th>
          <th>Principal's Liability</th>
          <th>Agent's Liability</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Disclosed</strong></td>
          <td>Third party knows both that the agent acts for a principal and the principal's identity</td>
          <td>Bound if agent had authority (actual, apparent, or ratified)</td>
          <td>Generally <strong>not</strong> liable on the contract (unless agent agrees to be)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Partially Disclosed (Unidentified)</strong></td>
          <td>Third party knows the agent acts for a principal but does not know the principal's identity</td>
          <td>Bound if agent had authority</td>
          <td><strong>Liable</strong> on the contract unless otherwise agreed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Undisclosed</strong></td>
          <td>Third party has no notice that the agent acts for a principal</td>
          <td>Bound if agent had actual authority (apparent authority cannot exist here)</td>
          <td><strong>Liable</strong> on the contract</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <div class="callout-title">Undisclosed Principal Limitation</div>
      An undisclosed principal cannot be bound by apparent authority because the third party does not even know a principal exists. Only <strong>actual authority</strong> (or inherent authority/ratification) can bind an undisclosed principal. This is a frequently tested distinction.
    </div>

    <h4>2. Tort Liability &mdash; Respondeat Superior</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Respondeat Superior</div>
      A principal (employer) is vicariously liable for torts committed by an agent (employee) acting within the <strong>scope of employment</strong>. This applies regardless of whether the principal was at fault.
    </div>

    <p><strong>Scope of employment</strong> factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Was the conduct of the kind the employee was hired to perform?</li>
      <li>Did it occur substantially within the authorized time and space limits?</li>
      <li>Was it actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Employee vs. Independent Contractor:</strong> Respondeat superior generally applies only to employees, not independent contractors. The key distinction is the degree of <strong>control</strong> the principal exercises over the manner and means of the agent's work. If the principal controls only the result (not how it is achieved), the agent is likely an independent contractor.</p>

    <p>Exceptions where a principal may be liable for an independent contractor's torts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-delegable duties</strong> (e.g., maintaining safe premises, complying with regulatory requirements)</li>
      <li><strong>Inherently dangerous activities</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Apparent authority</strong> (the principal held out the contractor as its employee/agent)</li>
      <li><strong>Negligent hiring/supervision</strong> (direct liability of the principal)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Frolic and Detour</h4>

    <p>A <strong>detour</strong> is a minor deviation from the scope of employment &mdash; the employer remains vicariously liable. A <strong>frolic</strong> is a major departure from the scope of employment for purely personal reasons &mdash; the employer is generally not liable. The distinction is one of degree, and courts consider the extent of the deviation, whether the employee had resumed the employer's business, and the foreseeability of the conduct.</p>

    <h3>D. Duties in Agency</h3>

    <h4>1. Agent's Duties to Principal</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Duty of Loyalty</strong> &mdash; The agent must act solely for the benefit of the principal in matters connected with the agency. This includes not self-dealing, not competing with the principal, not using the principal's property for personal benefit, and not acting for adverse parties without the principal's informed consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Duty of Care</strong> &mdash; The agent must act with the competence and diligence normally exercised by agents in a similar position.</li>
      <li><strong>Duty of Obedience</strong> &mdash; The agent must follow the principal's reasonable instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Duty to Account</strong> &mdash; The agent must keep and render accounts of money or property received or paid on the principal's behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>Duty to Provide Information</strong> &mdash; The agent must use reasonable efforts to provide the principal with facts the agent knows or should know that are material to the agent's duties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Principal's Duties to Agent</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Duty of Compensation</strong> &mdash; Unless the agency is gratuitous, the principal must compensate the agent as agreed.</li>
      <li><strong>Duty of Indemnification</strong> &mdash; The principal must indemnify the agent for losses incurred while acting within the scope of the agency and in accordance with the principal's directions.</li>
      <li><strong>Duty of Cooperation</strong> &mdash; The principal must not unreasonably interfere with the agent's performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>E. Termination of Agency</h3>

    <p>An agency relationship may be terminated by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mutual agreement of principal and agent</li>
      <li>Revocation by the principal (at any time, though this may breach the agency contract)</li>
      <li>Renunciation by the agent</li>
      <li>Expiration of the agency term or accomplishment of the agency purpose</li>
      <li>Death or incapacity of either party (but note: under the Restatement (Third), death or incapacity does not automatically terminate; authority continues until the agent has notice)</li>
      <li>Destruction of the subject matter, or change of law making the authorized act illegal</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <div class="callout-title">Lingering Apparent Authority</div>
      Even after actual authority is revoked, the principal may remain bound by the agent's actions through <strong>lingering apparent authority</strong> if the principal fails to give adequate notice of the termination to third parties who previously dealt with the agent.
    </div>

    <p><strong>Agency Coupled with an Interest (Power Given as Security):</strong> An agency is irrevocable when the agent holds a security interest or other interest in the subject matter of the agency. The principal cannot unilaterally revoke, and the agency is not terminated by the principal's death or incapacity.</p>

    <!--  II. PARTNERSHIPS                                              -->
    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <h2>II. Partnerships</h2>

    <h3>A. General Partnerships &mdash; Formation</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Partnership Formation</div>
      A general partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit. <em>RUPA &sect; 202(a).</em> No filing or written agreement is required. A partnership can be formed by conduct alone.
    </div>

    <p>Factors indicating a partnership exists (when disputed):</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sharing of profits</strong> &mdash; Receipt of a share of profits creates a <em>presumption</em> that a partnership exists, unless the profits were received as payment for: (a) a debt, (b) wages or services, (c) rent, (d) an annuity or retirement benefit, (e) interest on a loan, or (f) consideration for the sale of a business or property.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-ownership of property</strong> &mdash; Joint ownership alone does not establish a partnership, but it is a relevant factor.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to participate in management</strong> &mdash; A strong indicator.</li>
        <li><strong>Agreement to share losses</strong> &mdash; Important but not required (sharing of profits creates an inference of loss sharing).</li>
        <li><strong>The parties' intent</strong> &mdash; Subjective labels are not controlling; the court examines the totality of the circumstances.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip: Profit Sharing</div>
      The sharing of profits is the single most important factor. On the exam, if you see profit sharing, discuss the presumption and whether any exception applies. If you see only a fixed payment (salary, rent, loan repayment), there is no presumption of partnership.
    </div>

    <h4>Partnership by Estoppel</h4>

    <p>A person who is not a partner can be held liable as if they were a partner if they represent themselves (or consent to being represented) as a partner, and a third party relies on that representation. Under RUPA &sect; 308, the person who held themselves out as a partner is liable to third parties who extended credit in reliance on the representation. If the representation is made publicly, the purported partner is liable even to those who did not actually know of the representation.</p>

    <h3>B. Partnership Property and Rights</h3>

    <p><strong>Partnership property</strong> belongs to the partnership entity, not to individual partners. A partner has no transferable interest in specific partnership property. Under RUPA, a partner's transferable interest is limited to the partner's share of profits, losses, and distributions &mdash; this economic interest can be transferred, but it does not give the transferee any right to participate in management or access partnership information.</p>

    <h3>C. Management and Authority</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Equal management rights:</strong> Each partner has an equal right to participate in management, regardless of capital contribution. <em>RUPA &sect; 401(f).</em></li>
      <li><strong>Ordinary matters:</strong> Decided by a majority of partners.</li>
      <li><strong>Extraordinary matters</strong> (e.g., amending the partnership agreement, admitting a new partner, undertaking unusual business): Require unanimous consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Agency of partners:</strong> Each partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business. An act of a partner that is apparently for carrying on the partnership's business in the ordinary course binds the partnership, unless the partner had no authority and the third party knew or had notice of the lack of authority. <em>RUPA &sect; 301.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Liability of Partners</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Joint and Several Liability</div>
      Under RUPA, partners are <strong>jointly and severally liable</strong> for all obligations of the partnership, whether arising in contract or in tort. <em>RUPA &sect; 306(a).</em> Under the older UPA, tort liability was joint and several, but contract liability was merely joint.
    </div>

    <p><strong>Incoming partners:</strong> A person admitted as a partner is not personally liable for any partnership obligation incurred before the person's admission. However, the incoming partner's capital contribution is at risk for pre-existing obligations. <em>RUPA &sect; 306(b).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Exhaustion rule:</strong> Under RUPA, a judgment creditor must first exhaust partnership assets before proceeding against individual partners (unless the partnership is bankrupt, the partner has agreed to be liable, or a court grants direct enforcement). <em>RUPA &sect; 307.</em></p>

    <h3>E. Fiduciary Duties of Partners</h3>

    <p>Under RUPA, partners owe the partnership and other partners two primary fiduciary duties:</p>

    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Duty of Loyalty</strong> (RUPA &sect; 404(b)):
          <ul>
            <li>Account to the partnership for any property, profit, or benefit derived from partnership business or use of partnership property (no self-dealing)</li>
            <li>Refrain from dealing with the partnership as or on behalf of an adverse party</li>
            <li>Refrain from competing with the partnership</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Duty of Care</strong> (RUPA &sect; 404(c)): Refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. Note: the RUPA standard is <em>gross negligence</em>, not ordinary negligence.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>Partners also owe a <strong>duty of good faith and fair dealing</strong> in the discharge of their duties and exercise of their rights. <em>RUPA &sect; 404(d).</em></p>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <div class="callout-title">RUPA Limits on Fiduciary Duties</div>
      RUPA takes the position that the fiduciary duties of partners are <strong>limited to those stated in the statute</strong>. The partnership agreement may not eliminate these duties but may identify specific types of activities that do not violate them, so long as the limitations are not manifestly unreasonable. This is a frequently tested nuance.
    </div>

    <h3>F. Dissociation</h3>

    <p><strong>Dissociation</strong> occurs when a partner ceases to be associated with the carrying on of the partnership business. RUPA &sect; 601 lists events causing dissociation, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The partner's express will to withdraw (a partner has the <strong>power</strong> to dissociate at any time, though doing so may breach the partnership agreement and create liability for damages)</li>
      <li>Expulsion by unanimous vote of the other partners</li>
      <li>Expulsion by judicial decree (for specified misconduct)</li>
      <li>Bankruptcy, death, or incapacity of the partner</li>
      <li>Expiration of the partnership term or completion of the undertaking</li>
    </ul>

    <p>After dissociation, the partner's <strong>duty of loyalty</strong> terminates (except as to matters arising before dissociation), and the partner's <strong>duty of care</strong> continues only with respect to pre-dissociation matters. The dissociated partner's apparent authority to bind the partnership continues for <strong>two years</strong> unless notice is given to third parties. <em>RUPA &sect; 702.</em></p>

    <h3>G. Dissolution and Winding Up</h3>

    <p>Dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. Under RUPA, dissolution occurs only in specific circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Partnership at will:</strong> Dissolution occurs upon any partner's express will to dissociate (by giving notice of intent to withdraw). <em>RUPA &sect; 801(1).</em></li>
      <li><strong>Partnership for a term or undertaking:</strong> Dissolution occurs when the term expires or undertaking is completed; or within 90 days after a partner's dissociation by death, bankruptcy, or wrongful dissociation, if at least half of the remaining partners agree to wind up. <em>RUPA &sect; 801(2).</em></li>
      <li><strong>Judicial dissolution:</strong> A court may order dissolution on application by a partner when the economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated, another partner has engaged in conduct that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on, or it is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the partnership business in conformity with the partnership agreement. <em>RUPA &sect; 801(5).</em></li>
      <li><strong>Events specified in the partnership agreement.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Winding up:</strong> After dissolution, the partnership continues only for the purpose of winding up its business. Partners who have not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up. Priority of distributions during winding up: (1) creditors (including partner-creditors), (2) return of capital contributions, (3) distribution of surplus (per partnership agreement or equally).</p>

    <h3>H. Limited Partnerships (LP)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Limited Partnership</div>
      A limited partnership consists of at least one <strong>general partner</strong> (who manages the business and has unlimited personal liability) and one or more <strong>limited partners</strong> (who contribute capital and share in profits but traditionally have no management authority and limited liability). Formation requires filing a <strong>certificate of limited partnership</strong> with the state.
    </div>

    <p>Key rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Limited partner liability shield:</strong> A limited partner is not personally liable for partnership obligations solely by reason of being a limited partner, even if the limited partner participates in management (under RULPA 2001 and California law). The older "control rule" (limited partner loses protection by participating in control of the business) has been largely abolished but may still be tested.</li>
      <li><strong>General partner liability:</strong> General partners in an LP have the same unlimited liability as partners in a general partnership.</li>
      <li><strong>Fiduciary duties:</strong> General partners owe fiduciary duties. Limited partners generally do not owe fiduciary duties to the partnership or other partners (but they do owe the contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I. Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP)</h3>

    <p>An LLP is a general partnership that has elected LLP status by filing a statement with the state. The key advantage: partners in an LLP are <strong>not personally liable</strong> for the partnership's obligations arising from the negligence, wrongful acts, or misconduct of other partners or employees not under their direct supervision and control. In many states (including California), the liability shield is even broader, protecting partners from <em>all</em> partnership obligations, both tort and contract.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <div class="callout-title">California Distinction: LLP Liability Shield</div>
      California provides a <strong>full liability shield</strong> for LLP partners. Under California Corporations Code &sect; 16306(c), a partner in a registered LLP is not personally liable for any debts, obligations, or liabilities of the partnership or any other partner, whether arising in tort, contract, or otherwise. This is broader than the partial shield found in some other states (which only protect against tort liability of co-partners).

    <p>To form a corporation:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Incorporators</strong> execute and file <strong>articles of incorporation</strong> with the Secretary of State.</li>
        <li>The articles must include: (a) the corporate name, (b) the number of shares authorized, (c) the name and address of the registered agent, and (d) the name and address of each incorporator.</li>
        <li>Corporate existence begins when the articles are filed (or on a later date specified in the articles).</li>
        <li>After filing, the incorporators or the initial directors named in the articles hold an organizational meeting to adopt bylaws, appoint officers, and conduct other business.</li>
      </ol>

    </table>

    <div class="callout callout-warning">
      <div class="callout-title">MBCA Approach</div>
      Under the MBCA, the de facto corporation and corporation by estoppel doctrines have been <strong>abolished</strong>. Corporate existence begins upon filing of the articles, and persons who act on behalf of a corporation knowing there was no incorporation are jointly and severally liable for obligations incurred. <em>MBCA &sect; 2.04.</em> Some jurisdictions (and bar examiners) still test these doctrines, so know both approaches.
    </div>

    <h4>3. Promoter Liability</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Promoter Liability</div>
      A promoter who enters into a contract on behalf of a corporation that has not yet been formed is <strong>personally liable</strong> on the contract, even after the corporation is formed and adopts the contract, unless there is a <strong>novation</strong> (the third party, the corporation, and the promoter all agree to release the promoter and substitute the corporation).
    </div>

    <p>The corporation is <strong>not</strong> automatically bound by the promoter's pre-incorporation contracts. The corporation can become bound by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adoption</strong> &mdash; The board of directors expressly or impliedly adopts the contract after incorporation (binds the corporation but does not release the promoter).</li>
      <li><strong>Novation</strong> &mdash; All three parties agree to release the promoter and substitute the corporation (releases the promoter).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Piercing the Corporate Veil</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Piercing the Corporate Veil</div>
      Courts will disregard the corporate entity and hold shareholders personally liable when: (1) the shareholders have <strong>abused the corporate form</strong> (e.g., commingling of funds, failure to observe corporate formalities, undercapitalization, using the corporation as an alter ego or mere instrumentality), and (2) recognizing the corporate entity would <strong>sanction fraud or promote injustice</strong>.
    </div>

    <p>Factors courts consider (the "alter ego" test):</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Commingling of funds</strong> &mdash; Mixing personal and corporate finances</li>
        <li><strong>Failure to observe corporate formalities</strong> &mdash; No meetings, no minutes, no separate records</li>
        <li><strong>Undercapitalization</strong> &mdash; Corporation was not adequately capitalized at the time of formation to cover reasonably foreseeable liabilities</li>
        <li><strong>Siphoning of funds</strong> &mdash; Shareholders diverting corporate assets for personal use</li>
        <li><strong>Using the corporation as a mere shell, conduit, or instrumentality</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Overlap of ownership, officers, directors, and personnel</strong> between entities</li>
        <li><strong>Misrepresentation</strong> or fraud by shareholders</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <div class="callout-title">California Distinction: Piercing the Veil</div>
      California courts use a two-prong <strong>alter ego</strong> test: (1) there is such a unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its shareholder(s) that the separate personalities of the corporation and shareholder no longer exist, and (2) adherence to the fiction of separate existence would sanction a fraud or promote injustice. California courts will pierce the veil in both contract and tort cases. California is notable for being more willing to pierce the veil than many other jurisdictions, particularly when there is undercapitalization. California also does <strong>not</strong> require a showing of actual fraud &mdash; "promoting injustice" is sufficient.
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip: Piercing the Veil</div>
      Piercing the veil is one of the most frequently tested topics. On the exam, methodically go through each factor. Even if only a few factors are present, discuss them all and explain why each is or is not met. Remember: piercing is easier against closely held corporations and is very rarely applied to publicly traded corporations.

    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <!--  IV. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE                                      -->
    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <h2>IV. Corporate Governance</h2>

    <h3>A. Board of Directors</h3>

    <p>The board of directors manages the business and affairs of the corporation. Directors are not agents of the corporation; they act as a collective body. Key governance rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Directors are elected by shareholders at the annual meeting. Vacancies may be filled by the remaining directors or by shareholder vote.</li>
      <li><strong>Removal:</strong> Shareholders may remove directors with or without cause (under MBCA). If the board is classified (staggered terms), directors may only be removed for cause unless the articles provide otherwise.</li>
      <li><strong>Quorum:</strong> A majority of the fixed number of directors constitutes a quorum. An act of the board requires the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present.</li>
      <li><strong>Committees:</strong> The board may delegate authority to committees composed of one or more directors, but certain actions cannot be delegated (e.g., declaring dividends, amending bylaws, recommending fundamental changes, filling board vacancies).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Officers</h3>

    <p>Officers are agents of the corporation, appointed by the board of directors. They have the authority delegated by the board, the bylaws, or custom. Common officers include the CEO/President, Secretary, and Treasurer/CFO. Officers owe the same fiduciary duties as directors (duty of care and duty of loyalty). Officers serve at the pleasure of the board and may be removed at any time, with or without cause (though removal may give rise to a breach of contract claim if the officer has an employment contract).</p>

    <h3>C. Fiduciary Duties of Directors and Officers</h3>

    <h4>1. Duty of Care</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Duty of Care</div>
      Directors must discharge their duties in <strong>good faith</strong>, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the <strong>best interests of the corporation</strong>. <em>MBCA &sect; 8.30.</em>
    </div>

    <p>The duty of care requires directors to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Be informed</strong> &mdash; Make reasonable inquiry before making decisions; review relevant materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Exercise independent judgment</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Attend meetings regularly</strong> and monitor the corporation's affairs</li>
      <li><strong>Rely on experts</strong> when appropriate (attorneys, accountants, board committees) &mdash; but reliance must be in good faith and reasonable</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Business Judgment Rule (BJR)</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Business Judgment Rule</div>
      The business judgment rule is a <strong>presumption</strong> that in making a business decision, the directors acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. A court will <strong>not</strong> substitute its judgment for that of the board if the decision can be attributed to any rational business purpose. The burden is on the plaintiff to rebut the presumption.
    </div>

    <p>The BJR is rebutted when the plaintiff shows:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Self-interest or conflict of interest</strong> &mdash; A director had a personal financial interest in the transaction</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of good faith</strong> &mdash; The director acted with an improper purpose, engaged in intentional misconduct, or consciously disregarded known duties</li>
        <li><strong>Gross negligence</strong> in the decision-making process &mdash; The directors failed to inform themselves of all material information reasonably available (this is the standard from <em>Smith v. Van Gorkom</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Waste</strong> &mdash; The transaction was so one-sided that no reasonable business person would approve it</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip: BJR Analysis</div>
      On the exam, always apply the BJR as a framework. Start by stating the presumption, then analyze whether the plaintiff can rebut it. If the BJR applies, the directors win. If it is rebutted, the burden shifts to the directors to prove "entire fairness" (fair process and fair price).
    </div>

    <h4>3. Duty of Loyalty</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Duty of Loyalty</div>
      Directors and officers must act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders, not in their own personal interest. The duty of loyalty prohibits: (1) self-dealing transactions, (2) usurping corporate opportunities, and (3) competing with the corporation.
    </div>

    <h5>a. Self-Dealing Transactions (Interested Director Transactions)</h5>

    <p>A self-dealing transaction is one in which a director has a personal financial interest. Such transactions are <strong>not automatically void</strong>. Under the MBCA "safe harbor" provisions, an interested director transaction is not voidable solely because of the director's interest if any one of the following conditions is met:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Disinterested director approval</strong> &mdash; The transaction was approved by a majority of the disinterested directors (or a disinterested committee) after full disclosure of the conflict and all material facts.</li>
        <li><strong>Shareholder approval</strong> &mdash; The transaction was approved by a majority of disinterested shareholders after full disclosure.</li>
        <li><strong>Fairness</strong> &mdash; The transaction was fair to the corporation at the time it was authorized, approved, or ratified.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>If none of the safe harbors is met, the transaction is reviewed under the <strong>entire fairness</strong> standard: the interested director bears the burden of proving both fair dealing (process) and fair price (substance).</p>

    <h5>b. Corporate Opportunity Doctrine</h5>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Corporate Opportunity</div>
      A director or officer may not take for themselves a business opportunity that belongs to the corporation. A corporate opportunity exists when: (1) the corporation has an interest or expectancy in the opportunity, (2) the opportunity is in the corporation's line of business, or (3) the director learned of the opportunity through their corporate position or using corporate resources.
    </div>

    <p>To properly take a corporate opportunity, the director must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First present the opportunity to the board with <strong>full disclosure</strong></li>
      <li>Wait for the board to <strong>reject</strong> the opportunity (through a disinterested process)</li>
      <li>Only then may the director personally pursue it</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the corporation is <strong>financially unable</strong> to take advantage of the opportunity, this may be a defense in some jurisdictions, but it is not a universal defense. The safest course is always to present the opportunity to the board first.</p>

    <h5>c. Competing with the Corporation</h5>

    <p>A director may not compete with the corporation while serving as a director. Competition violates the duty of loyalty. A director planning to leave to start a competing business may make preparations (e.g., forming a new entity, negotiating a lease), but may not solicit the corporation's customers or employees or divert business before actually resigning.</p>

    <h4>4. Duty of Good Faith</h4>

    <p>Good faith is generally considered a component of the duty of loyalty rather than a freestanding duty (per <em>Stone v. Ritter</em>). Bad faith includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acting with a purpose other than advancing the corporation's best interests</li>
      <li>Intentional violation of law</li>
      <li><strong>Conscious disregard</strong> of known duties (failure of oversight / <em>Caremark</em> liability) &mdash; directors have a duty to implement and monitor a reasonable information and reporting system; a sustained or systematic failure to exercise oversight can constitute bad faith</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Exculpation and Indemnification</h4>

    <p><strong>Exculpation clauses:</strong> Under MBCA &sect; 2.02(b)(4) and Delaware DGCL &sect; 102(b)(7), the articles of incorporation may include a provision eliminating or limiting director personal liability for monetary damages for breach of the <strong>duty of care</strong>. However, such provisions may <strong>never</strong> eliminate liability for: (a) breach of the duty of loyalty, (b) acts or omissions not in good faith, (c) intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, or (d) improper distributions or personal benefit.</p>

    <p><strong>Indemnification:</strong> Corporations may (and sometimes must) indemnify directors for expenses incurred in defending suits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mandatory indemnification:</strong> A director who is wholly successful on the merits must be indemnified for reasonable expenses.</li>
      <li><strong>Permissive indemnification:</strong> A corporation may indemnify a director who acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation.</li>
      <li><strong>Court-ordered indemnification:</strong> A court may order indemnification if the director is fairly and reasonably entitled to it.</li>
      <li><strong>Advancement:</strong> The corporation may advance litigation expenses to a director, subject to repayment if the director is ultimately found not entitled to indemnification.</li>
    </ul>

    <!--  V. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS                                         -->
    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <h2>V. Shareholder Rights</h2>

    <h3>A. Voting Rights</h3>

    <p><strong>Record date:</strong> Only shareholders of record as of the record date are entitled to vote. The record date is set by the board, typically 10-70 days before the meeting.</p>

    <p><strong>Quorum:</strong> A majority of shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum. An act of the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present (unless a supermajority is required by the articles or bylaws).</p>

    <p><strong>Proxy voting:</strong> A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf. A proxy is generally revocable unless it is "coupled with an interest" (the proxy holder has a legal interest in the shares, such as a pledge). Under the MBCA, a proxy is valid for 11 months unless otherwise provided.</p>

    <p><strong>Cumulative voting:</strong> In cumulative voting, a shareholder may multiply their shares by the number of directors to be elected and cast all votes for a single candidate (or distribute them). This helps minority shareholders elect at least one director. Cumulative voting is mandatory in some jurisdictions and optional in others.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <div class="callout-title">California Distinction: Cumulative Voting</div>
      California mandates <strong>cumulative voting</strong> for the election of directors in all corporations (unless the corporation is a "listed corporation" on a major stock exchange and has eliminated cumulative voting in its articles). Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 708. This is more protective of minority shareholders than the MBCA, which only requires cumulative voting if the articles so provide.
    </div>

    <p><strong>Voting agreements and voting trusts:</strong> Shareholders may enter agreements to vote in a specified manner. A voting trust involves transferring legal title to shares to a trustee who votes them. Voting trusts are generally valid for a term of up to 10 years.</p>

    <h3>B. Shareholder Suits</h3>

    <h4>1. Direct Suits</h4>
    <p>A shareholder brings a <strong>direct suit</strong> when the shareholder has suffered a harm that is separate and distinct from any harm to the corporation. Examples include suits to enforce voting rights, compel declaration of a dividend, enforce inspection rights, or challenge an oppressive action against the individual shareholder.</p>

    <h4>2. Derivative Suits</h4>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Derivative Suits</div>
      A shareholder brings a <strong>derivative suit</strong> on behalf of the corporation when the corporation itself has suffered a harm (e.g., from director mismanagement) but the board refuses to sue. Any recovery goes to the <strong>corporation</strong>, not to the individual shareholder.
    </div>

    <p>Requirements for a derivative suit:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Standing</strong> &mdash; The plaintiff must be a shareholder at the time of the wrongful act (or must have acquired shares by operation of law from someone who was a shareholder at that time) &mdash; this is the <strong>contemporaneous ownership</strong> requirement. The plaintiff must also remain a shareholder throughout the litigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Demand</strong> &mdash; The plaintiff must make a written demand on the board of directors to take action, and wait a reasonable period (typically 90 days under MBCA) for the board to respond, unless demand would be <strong>futile</strong> (e.g., a majority of directors are interested or the challenged transaction was not a valid exercise of business judgment).</li>
        <li><strong>Fair and adequate representation</strong> &mdash; The plaintiff must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the corporation.</li>
        <li><strong>Security for expenses</strong> &mdash; Some jurisdictions require the plaintiff to post security for the corporation's litigation costs if the plaintiff owns a small percentage of shares.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Special Litigation Committees (SLC):</strong> The board may appoint a committee of independent directors to investigate the claims and recommend whether the suit should proceed. If the SLC recommends dismissal in good faith after a reasonable investigation, the court will generally defer to the committee's recommendation (under the BJR). However, the court retains discretion to deny dismissal if it determines the committee was not truly independent or the investigation was inadequate.</p>

    <h3>C. Inspection Rights</h3>

    <p>Shareholders have the right to inspect certain corporate books and records. Under the MBCA, a shareholder must make a written demand stating the purpose, and the purpose must be <strong>reasonably related to the shareholder's interest as a shareholder</strong> (a "proper purpose"). Certain records are available without any purpose requirement (e.g., articles, bylaws, annual reports, meeting minutes). Other records (accounting records, shareholder lists) require a proper purpose.</p>

    <h3>D. Appraisal Rights (Dissenters' Rights)</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: Appraisal Rights</div>
      Shareholders who dissent from certain fundamental corporate changes (typically mergers, asset sales, or share exchanges) have the right to demand that the corporation purchase their shares at <strong>fair value</strong> as determined by a court. This is the shareholder's exclusive remedy in most cases (they cannot challenge the transaction itself, only demand fair value).
    </div>

    <p>Procedural requirements for exercising appraisal rights:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li>The shareholder must <strong>provide written notice</strong> of intent to demand payment before the shareholder vote on the transaction.</li>
        <li>The shareholder must <strong>vote against</strong> the transaction (or abstain).</li>
        <li>After the transaction is approved, the shareholder must <strong>demand payment</strong> within the specified time period.</li>
        <li>If the parties cannot agree on fair value, either party may petition the court for a judicial determination.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Market-out exception:</strong> Under the MBCA, appraisal rights are generally <strong>not</strong> available if the shares are publicly traded on a national securities exchange (the theory being that the shareholder can simply sell on the open market). However, this exception does not apply if the consideration offered in the merger is anything other than cash or publicly traded shares.</p>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <!--  VI. FUNDAMENTAL CORPORATE CHANGES                             -->
    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <h2>VI. Fundamental Corporate Changes</h2>

    <p>Fundamental changes alter the basic nature of the corporation or the shareholders' rights. They generally require: (1) board resolution recommending the change, (2) notice to shareholders, and (3) shareholder approval (typically by a majority of shares entitled to vote, though some changes may require a supermajority).</p>

    <h3>A. Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation</h3>
    <p>The board adopts a resolution recommending the amendment, shareholders are given notice, and the amendment must be approved by a majority of shares entitled to vote (or a greater percentage if required by the articles). Certain amendments that adversely affect a particular class of shares may require approval by that class voting as a separate group.</p>

    <h3>B. Mergers and Consolidations</h3>

    <p>In a <strong>merger</strong>, one corporation absorbs another (the surviving corporation continues; the merged corporation ceases to exist). In a <strong>consolidation</strong>, two corporations combine to form a new entity (both original corporations cease to exist). Procedure: (1) board of each corporation adopts a plan of merger/consolidation, (2) shareholders of each corporation approve (majority of shares entitled to vote), (3) articles of merger are filed.</p>

    <p><strong>Short-form merger:</strong> A parent corporation that owns at least 90% of a subsidiary's shares may merge with the subsidiary without a shareholder vote of either corporation. The parent's board simply adopts a resolution. Minority shareholders of the subsidiary are entitled to appraisal rights.</p>

    <p><strong>Triangular merger:</strong> The acquiring corporation creates a subsidiary, and the target merges into the subsidiary. This structure allows the acquirer to avoid a shareholder vote (only the subsidiary's board approves, and the acquirer is the subsidiary's sole shareholder).</p>

    <h3>C. Sale of Substantially All Assets</h3>

    <p>A sale of all or substantially all of the corporation's assets outside the ordinary course of business requires board approval and shareholder approval. "Substantially all" is generally defined quantitatively (e.g., more than 75% of assets) and qualitatively (leaving the corporation unable to continue its business). Shareholders of the selling corporation have appraisal rights.</p>

    <h3>D. Dissolution</h3>

    <p><strong>Voluntary dissolution:</strong> The board recommends dissolution, and shareholders approve. After approval, the corporation files articles of dissolution and proceeds to wind up (pay debts, distribute remaining assets to shareholders).</p>

    <p><strong>Involuntary dissolution:</strong> A court may order dissolution on the petition of a shareholder if: (a) the directors are deadlocked and the deadlock is causing irreparable injury, (b) the directors are acting illegally, oppressively, or fraudulently, (c) the shareholders are deadlocked and cannot elect directors, or (d) corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <div class="callout-title">California Distinction: Involuntary Dissolution</div>
      Under California Corporations Code &sect; 1800, any shareholder holding at least one-third of the outstanding shares (or 50 holders under Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 1800(b)(2)) may petition for involuntary dissolution on grounds including internal dissension, deadlock, fraud, mismanagement, or abuse of authority. In a closely held corporation, a holder of even a single share may petition under &sect; 1800(b)(5) if the controlling shareholders have been guilty of fraud, mismanagement, or abuse. California also provides a buy-out alternative: when dissolution is sought, the corporation or other shareholders may avoid dissolution by purchasing the petitioning shareholder's shares at fair value. <em>Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 2000.</em>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <h2>VII. Securities Basics</h2>

    <h3>A. What Is a Security?</h3>

    <p>Under both federal and state law, a "security" includes stocks, bonds, notes, and <strong>investment contracts</strong>. The <strong>Howey test</strong> defines an investment contract as: (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with the expectation of profits, (4) derived solely from the efforts of others.</p>

    <h3>B. Registration and Exemptions</h3>

    <p>The Securities Act of 1933 requires that securities be <strong>registered</strong> with the SEC before being offered or sold, unless an exemption applies. Common exemptions include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Private placement (Regulation D, Rule 506)</strong> &mdash; Offers to accredited investors and a limited number of sophisticated non-accredited investors, without general solicitation</li>
      <li><strong>Intrastate offering (Rule 147)</strong> &mdash; Offers limited to residents of a single state by an issuer incorporated and doing business in that state</li>
      <li><strong>Regulation A</strong> &mdash; A simplified registration process for smaller offerings</li>
      <li><strong>Rule 144</strong> &mdash; Resale of restricted securities after a holding period</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Anti-Fraud Provisions</h3>

    <p><strong>Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5</strong> of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibit fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. To establish a Rule 10b-5 claim, a plaintiff must prove:</p>
    <div class="elements-list">
      <ol>
        <li>A material <strong>misrepresentation or omission</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Scienter</strong> (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud)</li>
        <li>In connection with the <strong>purchase or sale</strong> of a security</li>
        <li><strong>Reliance</strong> (or reliance presumed under the "fraud on the market" theory for publicly traded securities)</li>
        <li><strong>Economic loss</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Loss causation</strong> (the misrepresentation caused the loss)</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>D. Insider Trading</h3>

    <p>Insider trading under Rule 10b-5 is based on two theories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Classical theory:</strong> Corporate insiders (directors, officers, controlling shareholders) breach their fiduciary duty by trading on material nonpublic information. They must either <strong>disclose or abstain</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Misappropriation theory:</strong> A person who is not a corporate insider misappropriates confidential information from the source of the information (e.g., an employer, a client) and uses it to trade. This violates the duty owed to the source of the information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Tipper/Tippee liability:</strong> A tipper (insider who discloses material nonpublic information) is liable if they disclosed the information for a personal benefit (financial gain, gift, reputational enhancement). A tippee (recipient of the tip) is liable if the tippee knew or should have known that the tipper breached a duty.</p>

    <p><strong>Section 16(b) &mdash; Short-Swing Profits:</strong> Officers, directors, and shareholders holding more than 10% of a class of equity securities must disgorge any profits from purchases and sales (or sales and purchases) of the corporation's equity securities within a six-month period. This is a <strong>strict liability</strong> provision &mdash; no intent or misuse of inside information need be shown.</p>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <h2>VIII. Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)</h2>

    <h3>A. Formation</h3>

    <div class="callout callout-rule">
      <div class="callout-title">Rule: LLC Formation</div>
      An LLC is formed by filing <strong>articles of organization</strong> (or a certificate of organization) with the state. An LLC may have one or more members. No operating agreement is required for formation, but one is strongly advisable to govern internal affairs.
    </div>

    <p>LLCs combine the <strong>limited liability</strong> of corporations with the <strong>flexibility and pass-through taxation</strong> of partnerships. Members are not personally liable for the obligations of the LLC solely by reason of being members.</p>

    <h3>B. Operating Agreement</h3>

    <p>The <strong>operating agreement</strong> is the foundational document governing the LLC's internal affairs, including management structure, allocation of profits and losses, distribution rights, transfer restrictions, and dissolution triggers. Under RULLCA, the operating agreement can be oral, written, or implied from conduct. The operating agreement may modify default statutory rules with broad flexibility, but it may <strong>not</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eliminate the duty of loyalty or duty of care (though it may identify specific activities that do not violate these duties, if not manifestly unreasonable)</li>
      <li>Eliminate the obligation of good faith and fair dealing</li>
      <li>Unreasonably restrict the right of a member to information</li>
      <li>Vary the power of a court to decree dissolution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Management Structure</h3>

    <p>LLCs may be either <strong>member-managed</strong> or <strong>manager-managed</strong>:</p>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Feature</th>
          <th>Member-Managed (Default)</th>
          <th>Manager-Managed</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Decision-making</strong></td>
          <td>All members have equal authority to manage and bind the LLC; ordinary matters by majority vote; extraordinary matters by unanimous vote</td>
          <td>Managers (who may or may not be members) have exclusive authority to manage; members have no management authority unless designated as managers</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Agency</strong></td>
          <td>Each member is an agent of the LLC for business purposes</td>
          <td>Only managers are agents of the LLC; members who are not managers cannot bind the LLC</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Fiduciary duties</strong></td>
          <td>All members owe fiduciary duties (loyalty and care)</td>
          <td>Managers owe fiduciary duties; non-manager members generally do not (but owe good faith and fair dealing)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Analogy</strong></td>
          <td>Similar to a general partnership</td>
          <td>Similar to a limited partnership or corporation</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>D. Fiduciary Duties in LLCs</h3>

    <p>Under RULLCA, the fiduciary duties owed in an LLC parallel those in partnerships under RUPA:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Duty of Loyalty:</strong> Account for property, profit, or benefit derived from LLC business; refrain from dealing with the LLC as or on behalf of an adverse party; refrain from competing with the LLC.</li>
      <li><strong>Duty of Care:</strong> Refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law.</li>
      <li><strong>Good Faith and Fair Dealing:</strong> Non-waivable obligation.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <div class="callout-title">California Distinction: LLC Law</div>
      California's Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (Cal. Corp. Code &sect;&sect; 17701.01 et seq.) governs LLCs formed in California. Key California-specific rules:
      <ul>
        <li>California imposes fiduciary duties on managers of manager-managed LLCs and on all members of member-managed LLCs, consistent with RULLCA.</li>
        <li>California requires LLCs to file a biennial <strong>Statement of Information</strong> with the Secretary of State.</li>
        <li>California imposes an <strong>annual minimum franchise tax</strong> of $800 on all LLCs, regardless of income.</li>
        <li>California previously imposed an annual LLC fee based on total income (ranging from $900 to $11,790 for high-income LLCs); this fee was upheld by California courts despite constitutional challenges.</li>
        <li>The operating agreement cannot waive or restrict a member's right to bring a derivative action on behalf of the LLC.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>E. Transferability of Membership Interests</h3>

    <p>By default, a member's economic interest (right to distributions) is freely transferable, but governance rights (voting, management participation) are <strong>not</strong> transferable without the consent of all other members (or as provided in the operating agreement). A transferee of only the economic interest becomes an "assignee" but not a member.</p>

    <h3>F. Dissociation and Dissolution of LLCs</h3>

    <p><strong>Dissociation:</strong> A member may dissociate from an LLC by giving notice, or upon the occurrence of events specified in the operating agreement or statute (e.g., death, bankruptcy, expulsion). Upon dissociation, the member's governance rights terminate, but the member retains the right to receive distributions.</p>

    <p><strong>Dissolution:</strong> An LLC is dissolved upon:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Events specified in the operating agreement</li>
      <li>Consent of all members (or the percentage specified in the operating agreement)</li>
      <li>The passage of 90 consecutive days during which the LLC has no members</li>
      <li>Judicial decree on grounds that the LLC's managers or controlling members have acted illegally or fraudulently, or that dissolution is reasonably necessary because the economic purpose of the LLC is likely to be unreasonably frustrated</li>
      <li>Administrative dissolution for failure to file required documents or pay required fees</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Upon dissolution, the LLC winds up its affairs: it completes existing business, discharges liabilities, and distributes remaining assets to members.</p>

    <h3>G. Piercing the LLC Veil</h3>

    <p>Courts apply veil-piercing principles to LLCs in the same manner as to corporations. The same factors are considered: commingling of funds, failure to observe LLC formalities, undercapitalization, use of the LLC as a mere alter ego, and whether recognizing the LLC form would sanction fraud or promote injustice.</p>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip: LLC Formalities</div>
      Because LLCs have fewer required formalities than corporations (e.g., no mandatory meetings, minutes, or bylaws), the "failure to observe formalities" factor may carry less weight in the LLC veil-piercing analysis. Some states (including California) have codified that failure to observe formalities alone is not a ground for imposing personal liability on LLC members.

    <h2>IX. California-Specific Entity Rules</h2>

    <div class="callout callout-california">
      <div class="callout-title">California Distinctions: Comprehensive Summary</div>
      <p>California has numerous departures from the MBCA and uniform acts. The following summarizes the most testable California-specific rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cumulative voting:</strong> Mandatory for director elections (unless the corporation is publicly listed and has opted out). Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 708.</li>
        <li><strong>Classified boards:</strong> California does <strong>not</strong> allow classified (staggered) boards for closely held corporations with fewer than four directors.</li>
        <li><strong>Supermajority for certain actions:</strong> California requires approval of outstanding shares (not just shares present) for certain fundamental changes, including mergers and asset sales. Cal. Corp. Code &sect;&sect; 1001, 1101.</li>
        <li><strong>Interested director transactions:</strong> California's safe harbor requires approval by a majority of disinterested directors in good faith, or approval by disinterested shareholders, or demonstration that the transaction was "just and reasonable." Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 310.</li>
        <li><strong>Indemnification:</strong> California permits indemnification of directors and officers for expenses and judgments in most cases, but prohibits indemnification for acts adjudged to involve breach of duty to the corporation and its shareholders unless a court determines the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to it. Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 317.</li>
        <li><strong>Shareholder inspection rights:</strong> California grants inspection rights broadly. Any shareholder (regardless of holding size) may inspect and copy accounting records, minutes, and shareholder lists if the demand is made for a purpose reasonably related to the shareholder's interest. Holders of 5% or more of the outstanding shares (or holders holding shares with an aggregate market value of at least $1 million) have broader rights and may inspect virtually all corporate records. Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 1600-1605.</li>
        <li><strong>Dissolution:</strong> California allows involuntary dissolution by holders of one-third of outstanding shares; provides a buy-out alternative under &sect; 2000.</li>
        <li><strong>Close corporations:</strong> California has special provisions for close corporations (Cal. Corp. Code &sect;&sect; 158, 186, 300(b)), allowing the articles to restrict transfer of shares, provide that all corporate powers shall be exercised by the shareholders (eliminating the board), and include buy-sell provisions upon death or other triggering events.</li>
        <li><strong>LLP full liability shield:</strong> Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 16306(c) provides full (not partial) protection from partner liability in an LLP.</li>
        <li><strong>LLC annual tax:</strong> California imposes a minimum $800 annual franchise tax on all LLCs.</li>
        <li><strong>Dividends:</strong> California's dividend test is different from the MBCA. California uses a "retained earnings" test or an asset-based "balance sheet" test (assets must be at least 1.25 times liabilities, and current assets must at least equal current liabilities). Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 500.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <h2>X. Common Essay Patterns</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Pattern 1: Agency Authority and Liability</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Typical fact pattern:</strong> An agent enters into a contract on behalf of a principal. The principal disputes being bound, or the agent seeks to avoid personal liability. The third party claims reliance on the agent's authority.</p>
        <p><strong>Key issues to spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Was the principal disclosed, partially disclosed, or undisclosed?</li>
          <li>Did the agent have actual authority (express or implied)?</li>
          <li>If not, did the agent have apparent authority? (What manifestation came from the principal?)</li>
          <li>Has the principal ratified the agent's unauthorized act?</li>
          <li>Is the agent personally liable on the contract?</li>
          <li>If a tort occurred, was the agent an employee or independent contractor? Was the tort within the scope of employment?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Analyze each type of authority in order: actual (express, then implied), apparent, inherent/agency power, ratification, estoppel. Then address liability based on the type of principal.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Pattern 2: Piercing the Corporate Veil</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Typical fact pattern:</strong> A creditor of a corporation (often a tort victim) seeks to hold individual shareholders personally liable. The corporation is undercapitalized, run informally, or used to siphon funds.</p>
        <p><strong>Key issues to spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is the corporation closely held? (Piercing is far more common here.)</li>
          <li>Was there commingling of personal and corporate funds?</li>
          <li>Were corporate formalities observed (meetings, minutes, separate accounts)?</li>
          <li>Was the corporation adequately capitalized at inception?</li>
          <li>Was the corporation used as a mere instrumentality or alter ego?</li>
          <li>Would adherence to the corporate fiction sanction fraud or promote injustice?</li>
          <li>If in California, apply the specific two-prong alter ego test.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> State the general rule of limited liability, then systematically address each piercing factor. Conclude with whether the injustice/fraud prong is met.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Pattern 3: Director Fiduciary Duties and the BJR</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Typical fact pattern:</strong> Directors approve a transaction that results in losses. Shareholders challenge the decision. The directors may have a conflict of interest or may not have been fully informed.</p>
        <p><strong>Key issues to spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Did the directors satisfy the duty of care (were they informed)?</li>
          <li>Is there a self-dealing transaction triggering duty of loyalty analysis?</li>
          <li>Does the BJR apply, or is it rebutted?</li>
          <li>If self-dealing, was a safe harbor satisfied (disinterested director approval, shareholder approval, or intrinsic fairness)?</li>
          <li>Did the directors usurp a corporate opportunity?</li>
          <li>Is there an exculpation clause in the articles? (It can shield duty of care claims but not duty of loyalty.)</li>
          <li>Was there waste (a transaction so one-sided that no reasonable person would approve it)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Start with the BJR presumption. Assess whether it applies or is rebutted. If rebutted, shift to entire fairness. Address self-dealing safe harbors if relevant.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Pattern 4: Partnership Formation and Liability Disputes</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Typical fact pattern:</strong> Two or more persons collaborate in a business venture. A third party is injured or enters a contract and seeks to hold one or more individuals personally liable. The individuals dispute whether a partnership exists.</p>
        <p><strong>Key issues to spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is there profit sharing? If so, the presumption of partnership applies (unless an exception exists).</li>
          <li>Do the parties share management control?</li>
          <li>Did the parties intend to form a partnership (labels are not dispositive)?</li>
          <li>Is there partnership by estoppel (a person held out as a partner)?</li>
          <li>If a partnership exists, what are the partners' individual liabilities (joint and several under RUPA)?</li>
          <li>Was the partner acting within the scope of the partnership's business?</li>
          <li>Is the creditor subject to the exhaustion requirement (must pursue partnership assets first under RUPA)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Analyze formation factors (especially profit sharing). Discuss partnership by estoppel as an alternative theory. Address partner liability and the exhaustion rule.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Pattern 5: Shareholder Derivative Suits and Oppression</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Typical fact pattern:</strong> A minority shareholder in a closely held corporation is being squeezed out through excessive salaries to controlling shareholders, refusal to pay dividends, exclusion from management, or below-market transactions with insiders.</p>
        <p><strong>Key issues to spot:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is the suit direct or derivative? (Did the harm affect the shareholder individually or the corporation?)</li>
          <li>If derivative, has the demand requirement been met or is it excused as futile?</li>
          <li>Does the shareholder meet the contemporaneous ownership requirement?</li>
          <li>Has the board formed a special litigation committee? Is it independent?</li>
          <li>Is the controlling shareholder engaged in oppressive conduct (in California, grounds for involuntary dissolution)?</li>
          <li>In California, is the buy-out remedy under &sect; 2000 available as an alternative to dissolution?</li>
          <li>Can the court impose equitable relief (e.g., ordering dividends, requiring proportional employment)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Classify the suit as direct or derivative. If derivative, address procedural requirements. Analyze the underlying fiduciary breach. In California, discuss the involuntary dissolution statute and buy-out remedy.</p>

    <h2>XII. Exam Tips</h2>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Tip 1: Start with Agency</div>
      Nearly every Business Associations question involves agency at some level. Even if the question focuses on corporate or partnership liability, the threshold question is often whether the person who acted had authority to bind the entity. Always begin your analysis by identifying the agency relationship and the type of authority involved.
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Tip 2: Follow the Framework for Fiduciary Duties</div>
      When analyzing director conduct: (1) State the duty of care standard, (2) State the BJR presumption, (3) Analyze whether the BJR is rebutted, (4) If a conflict exists, analyze under the duty of loyalty with safe harbors, (5) If no safe harbor applies, apply entire fairness. This framework will keep your analysis organized and earn maximum points.
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Tip 3: Distinguish Direct from Derivative Claims</div>
      This classification matters enormously for procedural requirements and who receives the recovery. Ask: "Was the harm to the shareholder personally (direct), or was it to the corporation (derivative)?" If the shareholder's injury is merely the pro rata effect of an injury to the corporation, the suit is derivative. If the shareholder has a unique, individual injury (e.g., denial of voting rights), it is direct.
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-tip">
      <div class="callout-title">Tip 4: Always Address California Distinctions</div>
      The California Bar Exam expects you to identify and discuss California-specific rules whenever they differ from the majority/MBCA approach. Flag these differences explicitly. Key areas: cumulative voting, interested director transactions (Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 310), the alter ego veil-piercing test, involuntary dissolution standards, LLP full liability shield, and the California dividend test.

      If the exam asks a client what type of entity to form, compare: general partnership (easy formation, unlimited liability), LP (limited liability for limited partners, at least one general partner with unlimited liability), LLP (liability shield for all partners, requires filing), corporation (strongest shield, double taxation, most formalities), S-Corp (pass-through taxation, restrictions on shareholders), and LLC (combines limited liability with flexibility, pass-through taxation, fewer formalities). Discuss tax implications, liability protection, management flexibility, and formalities.
