      <h1>Evidence</h1>
      <p class="subject-meta">Frequency: Very High | Last tested: July 2024 | Weight: Crossover with Criminal Procedure, Constitutional Law, Professional Responsibility</p>

      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>Evidence is one of the most heavily tested subjects on the California Bar Exam. It appears on the MBE (approximately 25 of 175 scored questions) and is a regular essay topic, frequently crossing over with Criminal Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Professional Responsibility. The California Bar tests both the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) and the California Evidence Code (CEC), and you must know the key differences between them.</p>

      <p>The bar examiners expect you to systematically analyze evidence issues in a logical sequence: relevance first, then character evidence and policy exclusions, then hearsay (including all layers), then privileges, and finally constitutional constraints (Confrontation Clause). An essay that jumps randomly between topics will score poorly even if the substantive analysis is correct.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip</div>
        <p>On the essay portion, always state which body of law you are applying. The call of the question typically specifies "federal law" or "California law." If it says California law, discuss the CEC rules specifically. If it says federal law, apply the FRE. If ambiguous, discuss both and note the distinctions. On the MBE, apply the FRE exclusively.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction</div>
        <p>The CEC is a comprehensive statutory code, not a set of rules like the FRE. Many CEC provisions mirror the FRE, but critical differences exist in areas including: character evidence (CEC allows opinion and specific-act evidence in civil cases), hearsay (CEC classifies admissions as hearsay subject to an exception rather than non-hearsay), the Dead Man&rsquo;s Statute (CEC &sect; 1261), expert testimony (Kelly/Frye standard rather than Daubert), additional privileges (psychotherapist, physician, clergy), and judicial notice (mandatory vs. permissive categories).</p>
      </div>

      <p>Key themes the examiners test repeatedly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relevance and FRE 403 balancing</li>
        <li>Character evidence rules and their exceptions (especially 404(b))</li>
        <li>Hearsay within hearsay and the full catalog of exceptions</li>
        <li>Impeachment methods and the rules governing each</li>
        <li>Privileges&mdash;especially attorney-client and spousal privileges</li>
        <li>Confrontation Clause under <em>Crawford v. Washington</em></li>
        <li>FRE vs. CEC distinctions on every major topic</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="relevance">I. Relevance</h2>

      <h3 id="relevance-defined">A. Relevance Defined (FRE 401)</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule &mdash; FRE 401</div>
        <p>Evidence is <strong>relevant</strong> if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action. The threshold is very low&mdash;any tendency is sufficient.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Under FRE 402, relevant evidence is generally admissible; irrelevant evidence is never admissible. CEC &sect; 210 defines relevant evidence similarly: evidence &ldquo;having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.&rdquo;</p>

      <h3 id="fre-403">B. Prejudice Balancing (FRE 403)</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule &mdash; FRE 403</div>
        <p>The court <strong>may</strong> exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is <strong>substantially outweighed</strong> by a danger of: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction &mdash; CEC &sect; 352</div>
        <p>CEC &sect; 352 mirrors FRE 403 but uses slightly different language: the court &ldquo;in its discretion may exclude evidence if its probative value is <strong>substantially outweighed</strong> by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.&rdquo; The standard is functionally identical, but note the balancing always favors admissibility&mdash;the evidence must be <em>substantially</em> outweighed.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="policy-exclusions">C. Policy-Based Exclusions (FRE 407&ndash;411)</h3>
      <p>Even when evidence is relevant, certain policy concerns lead to categorical exclusion rules. These rules exist to encourage socially desirable behavior (settling disputes, repairing dangerous conditions, paying medical bills).</p>

        <p>Evidence of a person&rsquo;s character or character trait is <strong>not admissible</strong> to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with that character or trait. This is the propensity rule: you cannot argue &ldquo;D is a violent person, therefore D committed this violent act.&rdquo;</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Exceptions in Criminal Cases (FRE 404(a)(2))</h4>
      <ul class="elements-list">
        <li><strong>Defendant&rsquo;s Character (Mercy Rule):</strong> A criminal defendant may introduce evidence of a <em>pertinent</em> character trait. If the defendant opens the door, the prosecution may rebut with evidence of the same trait. Under FRE, character evidence in this context is limited to <strong>reputation or opinion testimony</strong> (not specific acts on direct; specific acts allowed only on cross-examination of the character witness).</li>
        <li><strong>Victim&rsquo;s Character:</strong> A criminal defendant may offer evidence of a pertinent trait of the victim (e.g., victim&rsquo;s violence in a self-defense case). If the defendant attacks the victim&rsquo;s character, the prosecution may rebut with evidence of (1) the victim&rsquo;s good character for the same trait, and (2) the defendant&rsquo;s bad character for the same trait.</li>
        <li><strong>Homicide &mdash; Victim as Aggressor:</strong> In a homicide case, if the defendant claims the victim was the first aggressor, the prosecution may introduce evidence of the victim&rsquo;s peaceful character even if the defendant has not attacked the victim&rsquo;s character.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction &mdash; Character Evidence</div>
        <p>Under the CEC, character evidence in criminal cases may be proved by <strong>opinion, reputation, or specific instances of conduct</strong> (CEC &sect; 1102). This is broader than the FRE, which limits character evidence on direct to reputation and opinion only. In California civil cases, CEC &sect; 1101(a) similarly prohibits character evidence to prove conduct, but when character evidence is admissible (e.g., character in issue), California allows all three methods: opinion, reputation, and specific acts.</p>

        <p>Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is <strong>not admissible</strong> to prove character in order to show action in conformity therewith. However, such evidence <strong>may be admissible</strong> for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.</p>
      </div>

The full list is often memorized as <strong>MIMIC KOPPD</strong>: Motive, Intent, Mistake (absence of), Identity, Common plan, Knowledge, Opportunity, Preparation, Plan, absence of acciDent.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Under FRE 404(b)(2), the prosecution in a criminal case must provide <strong>reasonable notice</strong> before trial of the general nature of any 404(b) evidence it intends to offer. The evidence must still pass FRE 403 balancing&mdash;the probative value for the non-propensity purpose must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Distinction &mdash; CEC &sect; 1101(b)</div>
        <p>CEC &sect; 1101(b) tracks FRE 404(b) closely. Evidence of uncharged acts is admissible to prove motive, intent, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. California courts also apply CEC &sect; 352 balancing. The California Supreme Court&rsquo;s analysis in <em>People v. Ewoldt</em> establishes a sliding scale: the degree of similarity required between the prior act and the charged offense depends on the purpose for which the evidence is offered (least similarity needed for intent, more for common plan, most for identity).</p>

      <h3 id="habit">C. Habit Evidence (FRE 406)</h3>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule &mdash; FRE 406</div>
        <p>Evidence of a person&rsquo;s <strong>habit</strong> or an organization&rsquo;s <strong>routine practice</strong> may be admitted to prove that the person or organization acted in accordance with the habit or routine practice on a particular occasion. Habit is admissible regardless of whether it is corroborated and regardless of whether an eyewitness is available.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Habit is distinguished from character: habit is a <strong>semi-automatic, specific, repeated response</strong> to a particular situation (e.g., always buckling a seatbelt, always descending a staircase on the left side, always locking the door upon leaving). Character is a general disposition (e.g., carefulness, aggressiveness). The key markers of habit are <strong>specificity</strong> and <strong>regularity</strong>.</p>

      <h3 id="impeachment">B. Impeachment</h3>
      <p>Impeachment is the process of attacking a witness&rsquo;s credibility. Any party may impeach any witness, including its own (FRE 607; CEC &sect; 785). The major impeachment methods are:</p>

      <ul class="elements-list">
        <li><strong>Prior Inconsistent Statements (FRE 613):</strong> A witness may be impeached with a prior statement inconsistent with the witness&rsquo;s trial testimony. Under FRE 613, extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement is admissible only if the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement and the opposing party is given an opportunity to examine the witness about it (or the interests of justice otherwise require). The foundation need not be laid before introducing extrinsic evidence. Under CEC &sect; 770, the witness must be given the opportunity to explain or deny <em>before</em> extrinsic evidence is admitted, unless the witness has not yet been excused and can still be recalled.</li>

        <li><strong>Bias, Interest, or Motive:</strong> Evidence that a witness has a reason to favor or disfavor a party is always relevant to credibility. The FRE does not have a specific rule on bias, but the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Abel</em> (1984) confirmed that bias is always a proper basis for impeachment. Extrinsic evidence of bias is admissible (unlike character for untruthfulness under 608(b)). Under CEC &sect; 780, bias is listed as a factor bearing on credibility.</li>

        <li><strong>Character for Untruthfulness (FRE 608):</strong> A witness&rsquo;s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness may be attacked by reputation or opinion testimony (FRE 608(a)). Specific instances of conduct probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness may be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness or a character witness, but <strong>extrinsic evidence is not admissible</strong> to prove specific instances of conduct under FRE 608(b).

        <li><strong>Adoptive Admissions (801(d)(2)(B) / CEC &sect; 1221):</strong> A statement by another person that the party adopted. Adoption may be express or implied. <em>Tacit admission</em>: silence in response to a statement may be treated as adoption if (1) the party heard and understood the statement, (2) the party was able to deny it, and (3) a reasonable person in the party&rsquo;s position would have denied it. Does not apply when the party is in police custody (Miranda protections).</li>
        <li><strong>Authorized Admissions (801(d)(2)(C) / CEC &sect; 1222):</strong> Statement by a person authorized by the party to speak on the subject (e.g., spokesperson, attorney).</li>
        <li><strong>Agent/Employee Admissions (801(d)(2)(D)):</strong> Statement by a party&rsquo;s agent or employee concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship. Under FRE, the contents of the statement itself may be considered in determining whether the agency relationship exists (but cannot be the <em>sole</em> basis). CEC does <em>not</em> have a direct equivalent of 801(d)(2)(D); California uses CEC &sect; 1222 (authorized admissions) more narrowly.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-Conspirator Admissions (801(d)(2)(E) / CEC &sect; 1223):</strong> A statement by a co-conspirator made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The proponent must show: (1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the declarant and the party were members; (3) the statement was made during the conspiracy; and (4) the statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Preliminary factual determinations are made by the judge under FRE 104(a). The statement itself may be considered but is not sufficient alone. &ldquo;In furtherance&rdquo; means to advance the conspiracy&rsquo;s objectives&mdash;mere narratives about past events do not qualify.</li>

      <h2 id="confrontation">VII. Confrontation Clause</h2>

      <div class="callout callout-rule">
        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule &mdash; Crawford v. Washington (2004)</div>
        <p>The Sixth Amendment&rsquo;s Confrontation Clause prohibits the introduction of <strong>testimonial hearsay</strong> against a criminal defendant unless: (1) the declarant is <strong>unavailable</strong>, and (2) the defendant had a <strong>prior opportunity to cross-examine</strong> the declarant. This applies regardless of whether the statement falls within a hearsay exception.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>What is &ldquo;Testimonial&rdquo;?</h4>
      <p>The Supreme Court has not provided a comprehensive definition, but has identified categories:</p>
      <ul class="elements-list">
        <li><strong>Testimonial:</strong> Prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, grand jury, or former trial; affidavits; depositions; statements in response to police interrogation where the primary purpose is to establish or prove past events relevant to later criminal prosecution (<em>Davis v. Washington</em>, 2006).</li>
        <li><strong>Non-testimonial:</strong> Statements made during an ongoing emergency where the primary purpose is to enable police assistance to meet the emergency (<em>Davis v. Washington</em>); casual remarks to acquaintances; business records; co-conspirator statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Forensic reports:</strong> Certificates of analysis, autopsy reports, and lab reports prepared for litigation are testimonial (<em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</em>, 2009; <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico</em>, 2011). The analyst who performed the test generally must testify. <em>Williams v. Illinois</em> (2012) created ambiguity about reports not introduced for their truth but as basis for expert opinion.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Key Limitations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The Confrontation Clause applies only in <strong>criminal cases</strong> and only against <strong>the accused</strong>.</li>
        <li>It does not apply to non-testimonial hearsay&mdash;such statements are governed solely by the hearsay rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Forfeiture by wrongdoing</strong> (FRE 804(b)(6)) also results in forfeiture of Confrontation Clause rights (<em>Giles v. California</em>, 2008, but requiring intent to prevent testimony).</li>
        <li>Dying declarations may be a historical exception to the Confrontation Clause (dicta in <em>Crawford</em> and <em>Giles</em>), though the Court has not definitively ruled on this.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout callout-california">
        <div class="callout-title">California Note</div>
        <p>The Confrontation Clause applies in California state courts through the Fourteenth Amendment. California courts follow <em>Crawford</em> and its progeny. Additionally, Cal. Const. Art. I, &sect; 28(f)(2) (Proposition 115, the &ldquo;Right to Truth-in-Evidence&rdquo; provision) generally makes all relevant evidence admissible in criminal proceedings, but this is subject to the Confrontation Clause limitations established by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

        <div class="callout-title">Key Rule &mdash; FRE 901(a)</div>
        <p>To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is. This is a <strong>low threshold</strong>&mdash;a prima facie showing; the jury ultimately decides authenticity.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Common Authentication Methods (FRE 901(b) examples)</h4>
      <ul class="elements-list">
        <li><strong>Testimony of a witness with knowledge</strong> (901(b)(1)): A witness who has personal knowledge that the item is what it is claimed to be.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-expert handwriting comparison</strong> (901(b)(2)): Comparison by the trier of fact or an expert witness with specimens proved to be genuine.</li>
        <li><strong>Distinctive characteristics</strong> (901(b)(4)): Appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken in conjunction with the circumstances.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice identification</strong> (901(b)(5)): Identification of a voice based on hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.</li>
        <li><strong>Telephone conversations</strong> (901(b)(6)): For outgoing calls, evidence that a call was made to the number assigned to a particular person or business, plus self-identification or other circumstances showing the person answering is who is claimed. For incoming calls, self-identification alone is generally insufficient&mdash;additional corroborating circumstances are needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Public records</strong> (901(b)(7)): Evidence that the document is from the public office where items of that nature are kept.</li>
        <li><strong>Ancient documents</strong> (901(b)(8)): The document is in such condition as to create no suspicion about its authenticity, was found in a place where it would likely be if authentic, and has been in existence 20 years or more.</li>
        <li><strong>Process or system</strong> (901(b)(9)): Evidence describing a process or system and showing it produces an accurate result (e.g., photographs, x-rays, computer records).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Self-Authenticating Documents (FRE 902)</h4>
      <p>Certain documents are self-authenticating and do not require extrinsic evidence of authenticity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Domestic public documents under seal (902(1))</li>
        <li>Certified copies of public records (902(4))</li>

        <li>Newspapers and periodicals (902(6))</li>
        <li>Trade inscriptions (902(7))</li>
        <li>Acknowledged documents (902(8))</li>
        <li>Commercial paper and related documents (902(9))</li>

        <p>An <strong>original writing, recording, or photograph</strong> is required to prove the <strong>content</strong> of a writing, recording, or photograph, unless an exception applies. This rule applies when: (1) the writing is a legally operative document (e.g., a contract, a deed, a will); or (2) the witness&rsquo;s knowledge comes solely from having read the document. It does <em>not</em> apply when a witness testifies from personal knowledge of a fact that also happens to be recorded in a writing.</p>

      <h4>Key Provisions</h4>
      <ul class="elements-list">
        <li><strong>Duplicate (FRE 1003):</strong> A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless (1) a genuine question is raised about the original&rsquo;s authenticity, or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate. A duplicate includes a counterpart produced by any mechanical, photographic, chemical, electronic, or other equivalent process.</li>
        <li><strong>Excuses for Non-Production (FRE 1004):</strong> An original is not required and other evidence of content is admissible if: (a) the originals are lost or destroyed (not in bad faith); (b) the original cannot be obtained by judicial process; (c) the original is in the possession of the opponent who was notified to produce it and failed to do so; or (d) the writing is not closely related to a controlling issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Records (FRE 1005):</strong> A copy of a public record is admissible if certified or testified to be correct.</li>
        <li><strong>Summaries (FRE 1006):</strong> Voluminous writings may be presented in summary form. The originals must be made available for examination by the other party.</li>
        <li><strong>Judge and Jury (FRE 1008):</strong> The court determines whether the proponent has fulfilled the conditions for admitting other evidence of content. The jury determines genuineness and accuracy issues.</li>

        <p>CEC &sect;&sect; 1500&ndash;1553 codify California&rsquo;s &ldquo;secondary evidence rule.&rdquo; CEC &sect; 1521 provides that oral testimony of the content of a writing is generally inadmissible if the original is available. However, CEC &sect; 1523 allows oral testimony of the content of a writing if the proponent does not have possession or control of the original.

        <p>California&rsquo;s Evidence Code &sect; 606 presumptions are far more powerful than the FRE&rsquo;s bursting-bubble presumptions. When a &sect; 606 presumption applies, the opposing party must not only produce evidence to rebut but must actually <strong>persuade</strong> the trier of fact that the presumed fact is not true. Common examples: the presumption of ownership from title (&sect; 662), the presumption that a person not heard from in five years is dead (&sect; 667), and the presumption of due care (&sect; 668).

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Pattern 1: Hearsay + Confrontation Clause Crossover</strong></summary>
        <p>A common essay pattern presents a criminal case where the prosecution seeks to introduce an out-of-court statement by a witness who is unavailable at trial. The essay requires you to analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whether the statement is hearsay and whether an exception applies (work through the definition, identify each layer).</li>
          <li>Whether the statement is &ldquo;testimonial&rdquo; under <em>Crawford</em> (police interrogation? affidavit? casual statement to a friend?).</li>
          <li>If testimonial, whether the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.</li>
          <li>Whether forfeiture by wrongdoing applies if the defendant caused the witness&rsquo;s unavailability.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Pattern 2: Character Evidence + 404(b) Other Acts</strong></summary>
        <p>A fact pattern involving a criminal defendant where the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence of the defendant&rsquo;s prior bad acts. Analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is the evidence being offered to prove propensity (prohibited under 404(a)) or for a MIMIC purpose (permitted under 404(b))?</li>
          <li>Identify the specific non-propensity purpose and explain why the evidence is relevant to that purpose.</li>
          <li>Apply FRE 403 / CEC &sect; 352 balancing.</li>
          <li>If a sexual-assault case, discuss FRE 413&ndash;415 / CEC &sect; 1108 (propensity is allowed).</li>
          <li>Address FRE/CEC distinctions on the form of character evidence (reputation/opinion vs. specific acts).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Pattern 3: Privilege Issues (Attorney-Client + Spousal)</strong></summary>
        <p>A fact pattern where a party or witness asserts a privilege to prevent disclosure of a communication. Analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify which privilege applies (attorney-client, spousal testimonial, confidential communications, psychotherapist).</li>
          <li>Determine whether the communication was made in confidence and during the relevant relationship.</li>
          <li>Consider exceptions (crime-fraud, joint-client, patient-litigant, crime against a spouse).</li>
          <li>Analyze waiver (voluntary disclosure to a third party, inadvertent disclosure).</li>
          <li>Address FRE/CEC differences (especially who holds the spousal testimonial privilege).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Pattern 4: Impeachment Smorgasbord</strong></summary>
        <p>A fact pattern with multiple witnesses where the opposing party attempts to impeach using various methods. Analyze each method:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prior inconsistent statements (foundation requirements, substantive use under FRE vs. CEC).</li>
          <li>Bias/interest/motive (always admissible, extrinsic evidence permitted).</li>
          <li>Character for untruthfulness (608(a) reputation/opinion; 608(b) specific acts on cross only, stuck with the answer).</li>
          <li>Prior convictions (apply the 609 framework: type of crime, who is being impeached, time limit).</li>
          <li>Contradiction (collateral-matter rule limits extrinsic evidence).</li>
          <li>Rehabilitation (prior consistent statements, good character for truthfulness).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Pattern 5: Business Records / Public Records + Multiple Hearsay</strong></summary>
        <p>A fact pattern involving a document (hospital record, police report, business file) that contains statements from multiple sources. Analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Authentication of the document (901(a), or self-authentication under 902).</li>
          <li>Best Evidence Rule (is the original required? Is a duplicate acceptable?).</li>
          <li>Business-records exception (803(6)): foundation requirements (regular course of business, at or near the time, custodian or certification).</li>
          <li>Public-records exception (803(8)): limitations on law-enforcement reports in criminal cases.</li>
          <li>Hearsay within hearsay (805): analyze each layer independently.</li>
          <li>Confrontation Clause issues if in a criminal case (forensic lab reports are testimonial under <em>Melendez-Diaz</em>).</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <h2 id="checklist">XV. Issue-Spotting Checklist</h2>

      <p>Use this systematic checklist when analyzing any evidence issue on an essay. Work through the issues in this order:</p>

      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><strong>Step 1 &mdash; Relevance:</strong> Is the evidence relevant under FRE 401 / CEC &sect; 210? Does it have any tendency to make a consequential fact more or less probable?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2 &mdash; FRE 403 / CEC &sect; 352 Balancing:</strong> Even if relevant, should the evidence be excluded because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion, misleading the jury, or undue delay?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3 &mdash; Policy Exclusions:</strong> Does a specific policy rule apply (subsequent remedial measures, compromise offers, medical payments, pleas, insurance)?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4 &mdash; Character Evidence:</strong> Is character evidence being offered to prove propensity (generally prohibited)? Does an exception apply (mercy rule, 404(b) MIMIC, habit, sexual-assault rules)?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5 &mdash; Hearsay:</strong> Is the evidence an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted? If so, is it excluded from hearsay (admissions, prior statements of testifying witness)? Does an exception apply (803, 804, 807)?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6 &mdash; Hearsay Within Hearsay:</strong> If there are multiple layers, does each layer independently satisfy an exception or exclusion?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7 &mdash; Confrontation Clause:</strong> In a criminal case, is the statement testimonial? If so, was the declarant unavailable and did the defendant have a prior opportunity to cross-examine?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 8 &mdash; Witness Competency and Impeachment:</strong> Is the witness competent? What impeachment methods are being used? Are the foundation requirements met? Is extrinsic evidence admissible for this method?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 9 &mdash; Opinion Testimony:</strong> Is the witness offering a lay opinion (701) or expert opinion (702)? Does the expert meet the qualification and reliability standards (Daubert/Kelly-Frye)?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 10 &mdash; Privileges:</strong> Does a privilege apply? Has it been waived? Does an exception apply?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 11 &mdash; Authentication:</strong> Has the evidence been properly authenticated?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 12 &mdash; Best Evidence Rule:</strong> Is the content of a writing, recording, or photograph at issue? Is the original required?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 13 &mdash; Judicial Notice:</strong> Is a party asking the court to take judicial notice? Is the fact judicially noticeable? What is the effect?</li>
        <li><strong>Step 14 &mdash; FRE vs. CEC:</strong> If the question asks for California law, have you identified every applicable FRE/CEC distinction?</li>
      </ul>

        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip &mdash; Structure Your Answer</div>
        <p>Evidence essays reward methodical organization. For each piece of evidence challenged, work through: (1) Relevance, (2) Character/policy exclusion, (3) Hearsay (define, identify, exception), (4) Confrontation Clause (if criminal), (5) Privilege, (6) Authentication/Best Evidence. Do not skip steps&mdash;state your conclusion even if an issue is straightforward.</p>

      <div class="callout callout-tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip &mdash; Non-Hearsay Purposes</div>
        <p>Before concluding that a statement is hearsay, always ask: &ldquo;Is this being offered for a purpose <em>other than</em> the truth of the matter asserted?&rdquo; If the statement is a verbal act, offered for its effect on the listener, or offered as circumstantial evidence of the declarant&rsquo;s state of mind, it is not hearsay at all. This is one of the most commonly missed issues on evidence essays.</p>

        <p>On a California bar essay that asks you to apply California law, <strong>always note where the CEC differs from the FRE</strong>. Even a brief mention (&ldquo;Under the CEC, unlike the FRE, prior inconsistent statements are admissible for their truth regardless of whether they were given under oath&rdquo;) earns significant points. The graders are specifically looking for your ability to identify these distinctions.</p>

        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip &mdash; Multiple Grounds</div>
        <p>When a piece of evidence is potentially admissible under multiple theories, discuss all of them. For example, a party&rsquo;s out-of-court statement might be (1) an admission under 801(d)(2), (2) an excited utterance under 803(2), and (3) admissible for a non-hearsay purpose. Discussing multiple grounds demonstrates mastery and earns more points.</p>

        <div class="callout-title">Exam Tip &mdash; MBE Strategy</div>
        <p>On MBE questions, read the call of the question first. Evidence questions typically ask for the &ldquo;most likely&rdquo; ruling or the &ldquo;best&rdquo; objection/response. Eliminate answers that misstate rules. For hearsay questions, systematically check: (1) Is it hearsay? (2) Is it excluded from hearsay? (3) Does an exception apply? The most common incorrect MBE answers confuse exceptions or apply the wrong standard.</p>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Admission vs. Statement Against Interest</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Admission (801(d)(2)):</strong> Declarant must be a party. No unavailability requirement. No personal-knowledge requirement. Need not have been against interest when made. Under FRE, classified as non-hearsay; under CEC, hearsay with exception.</li>
          <li><strong>Statement Against Interest (804(b)(3)):</strong> Declarant need not be a party (and often is not). Declarant must be unavailable. Must have been against interest when made. Requires personal knowledge. If offered to exculpate a criminal defendant, must have corroborating circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Present Recollection Refreshed vs. Recorded Recollection</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Present Recollection Refreshed (FRE 612):</strong> Not a hearsay exception. The witness&rsquo;s memory is jogged by <em>any</em> item (document, photo, song&mdash;anything). The witness then testifies from refreshed memory. The writing itself is not admitted into evidence (though the opposing party may inspect it and introduce relevant portions). No foundation requirements regarding when the writing was made.</li>
          <li><strong>Recorded Recollection (FRE 803(5)):</strong> A hearsay exception. The witness <em>cannot</em> recall enough to testify fully. The writing was made or adopted when the matter was fresh. The writing accurately reflects the witness&rsquo;s knowledge. The writing may be read into evidence but not received as an exhibit (except by the adverse party). Under CEC &sect; 1237, the writing <em>may</em> be admitted as an exhibit.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Character Evidence vs. Habit Evidence</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Character:</strong> A general disposition or propensity (e.g., &ldquo;careful,&rdquo; &ldquo;aggressive,&rdquo; &ldquo;truthful&rdquo;). Generally inadmissible to prove conduct (with exceptions). Proved by reputation or opinion (FRE) or also specific acts (CEC in criminal cases). Subject to FRE 404 restrictions.</li>
          <li><strong>Habit:</strong> A specific, semi-automatic, repeated response to a particular stimulus (e.g., &ldquo;always signals before turning,&rdquo; &ldquo;always locks the safe every night at closing&rdquo;). Admissible to prove conduct on a specific occasion. No restrictions on method of proof. Not subject to 404 limitations.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Excited Utterance vs. Present Sense Impression</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Excited Utterance (803(2)):</strong> Requires a startling event. The declarant must still be under the stress of excitement. Statement need only &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; the event. Time may elapse as long as the stress persists. Available under both FRE and CEC.</li>
          <li><strong>Present Sense Impression (803(1)):</strong> No startling event required. The statement must be made while or immediately after perceiving the event. The statement must describe or explain the event. Near-contemporaneity is required. Available under FRE only; <strong>no CEC equivalent</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Spousal Testimonial Privilege vs. Confidential Marital Communications</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Testimonial Privilege:</strong> Prevents one spouse from testifying against the other. Covers <em>all</em> testimony. Exists only during the marriage. In federal court, the witness-spouse holds it; in California, either spouse. Applies to criminal cases (federal) or all cases (California).</li>
          <li><strong>Confidential Communications:</strong> Protects only confidential communications made during the marriage. Both spouses hold the privilege. Survives divorce (the communication remains privileged). Applies in both civil and criminal cases.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Daubert vs. Kelly/Frye</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Daubert (federal):</strong> Judge acts as gatekeeper. Multi-factor test: testability, peer review and publication, known error rate, general acceptance. More flexible&mdash;general acceptance is one factor among several. Applies to all expert testimony.</li>
          <li><strong>Kelly/Frye (California):</strong> The scientific technique must be &ldquo;generally accepted&rdquo; in the relevant scientific community. Applies only to <em>new or novel scientific techniques</em>. More conservative&mdash;single-factor test. For non-novel expert testimony, California uses the <em>Sargon</em> gatekeeper framework and CEC &sect; 352 balancing.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Business Records (803(6)) vs. Public Records (803(8))</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Business Records:</strong> Made in the regular course of a regularly conducted business activity. Foundation through custodian or certification. No automatic exclusion of law-enforcement records. The &ldquo;business&rdquo; can be any regularly conducted activity (hospital, school, nonprofit, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Public Records:</strong> Set out activities of the office, matters observed under a legal duty to report, or factual findings from an investigation. In criminal cases, matters observed by law enforcement are excluded when offered by the prosecution. The prosecution may not use the business-records exception to circumvent the public-records limitation on law-enforcement reports in criminal cases (<em>Palmer v. Hoffman</em> principle).</li>
