    <!-- ===== OVERVIEW ===== -->
    <h1>Trusts</h1>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h3>What Is a Trust?</h3>
      <p>A trust is a <strong>fiduciary relationship</strong> in which a <strong>trustee</strong> holds legal title to property (the <strong>res</strong> or corpus) for the benefit of one or more <strong>beneficiaries</strong>, as directed by the <strong>settlor</strong> (also called the trustor or grantor). Trusts are governed primarily by the <strong>Restatement (Third) of Trusts</strong>, the <strong>Uniform Trust Code (UTC)</strong>, and in California by the <strong>Probate Code sections 15000&ndash;18201</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Trusts appear frequently on the California Bar Exam, often combined with Wills &amp; Succession, Community Property, or Professional Responsibility. You must be able to analyze trust creation, trustee duties, modification/termination, and remedies for breach. California-specific rules &mdash; especially the presumption of revocability and Probate Code provisions &mdash; are heavily tested.</p>

    <!-- ===== TRUST CREATION ===== -->
    <h2 id="creation">I. Trust Creation</h2>

    <div class="callout-tip">
      <h3>The Five Elements of a Valid Express Trust</h3>
      <p>Remember: every valid private express trust requires <strong>(1) a settlor</strong> with capacity, <strong>(2) intent</strong> to create a trust, <strong>(3) trust property</strong> (res/corpus), <strong>(4) a valid purpose</strong>, and <strong>(5) an ascertainable beneficiary</strong>. A trustee is necessary for administration but is <em>not</em> essential at creation &mdash; a court will appoint one if needed.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>A. Settlor</h3>
    <p>The <strong>settlor</strong> is the person who creates the trust. The settlor must have the legal <strong>capacity</strong> to transfer property:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Inter vivos trust:</strong> Requires the same capacity as making a gift or contract (generally, the capacity to understand the nature and effect of one's acts).</li>
      <li><strong>Testamentary trust:</strong> Requires testamentary capacity (know the nature and extent of one's property, the natural objects of one's bounty, and the nature of the testamentary act).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Intent</h3>
    <p>The settlor must manifest a <strong>present intent</strong> to create a trust relationship. Key principles:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>No magic words required.</strong> The word "trust" need not be used. Courts look at the totality of the circumstances.</li>
      <li><strong>Precatory language</strong> (e.g., "I hope," "I wish," "I desire") is generally <em>not</em> sufficient to create a trust &mdash; it is treated as a mere moral obligation, not a legal one. However, extrinsic evidence may convert precatory words into trust intent if the context supports it.</li>
      <li><strong>Present vs. future intent:</strong> A promise to create a trust in the future is not a trust (though it may be enforceable as a contract if supported by consideration).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Trust Property (Res / Corpus)</h3>
    <p>There must be <strong>identifiable trust property</strong> (the "res" or "corpus") at the time the trust is created.</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Any transferable interest</strong> in property can serve as the res: real property, personal property, intangible property, contract rights, life insurance policies, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Future property</strong> (property the settlor does not yet own, such as an expectancy) <em>cannot</em> serve as the res. A trust of an expectancy fails for want of res. However, when the property is later acquired, a trust may arise under equity if there is adequate consideration.</li>
      <li><strong>Illusory trusts:</strong> If the settlor retains so much control that the trustee has no real duties and the beneficiary has no enforceable rights, the trust may be deemed <em>illusory</em> and void. Under the modern/CA view, however, a revocable trust in which the settlor retains broad powers is <strong>not</strong> illusory &mdash; it is valid.</li>
      <li><strong>The res must be segregated</strong> from the settlor's other property (for inter vivos trusts) or clearly identified (for testamentary trusts).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>CA Distinction &mdash; Declaration of Trust</h3>
      <p>In California, a settlor may create a valid trust by <strong>declaration</strong> &mdash; the settlor declares that they hold their own property as trustee. No transfer to a third-party trustee is required. (Prob. Code &sect; 15200.) This is extremely common for revocable living trusts.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>D. Valid Purpose</h3>
    <p>The trust must be created for a <strong>lawful purpose</strong> that is not contrary to public policy. A trust created to defraud creditors, to promote illegal activity, or that imposes conditions violating public policy (e.g., requiring a beneficiary to divorce or to refrain from marrying someone of a particular race) is invalid in whole or in part.</p>

    <h3>E. Ascertainable Beneficiary</h3>
    <p>A private express trust must have one or more <strong>definite and ascertainable</strong> beneficiaries:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>The beneficiaries must be identifiable at the time their interests are to be enjoyed (not necessarily at trust creation).</li>
      <li>A trust for the benefit of "my friends" or "worthy people" <strong>fails</strong> &mdash; the class is too indefinite.</li>
      <li><strong>Unborn beneficiaries</strong> are permissible if the class is sufficiently definite (e.g., "my grandchildren" &mdash; even if none are yet born).</li>
      <li><strong>Incidental beneficiaries</strong> have no standing to enforce the trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Exception for charitable trusts:</strong> Charitable trusts do <em>not</em> require ascertainable beneficiaries &mdash; they may benefit the public at large or an indefinite class.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>F. Trustee</h3>
    <p>A trust will <strong>not fail for want of a trustee</strong>. If no trustee is named, or the named trustee declines, a court will appoint one. Key rules:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> A trustee must accept the position; trusteeship is not forced. Acceptance can be express or implied (by conduct, such as exercising trust powers).</li>
      <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Any person with legal capacity to hold property may be a trustee. Minors and incompetents generally cannot serve.</li>
      <li><strong>Sole trustee who is sole beneficiary:</strong> If the same person is the sole trustee <em>and</em> sole beneficiary, legal and equitable title merge and the trust fails. But if there are other beneficiaries or other trustees, no merger.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mnemonic">
      <h3>Mnemonic: "STBIP" for Trust Creation Elements</h3>
      <p><strong>S</strong>ettlor with capacity &bull; <strong>T</strong>rust property (res) &bull; <strong>B</strong>eneficiary (ascertainable) &bull; <strong>I</strong>ntent (present) &bull; <strong>P</strong>urpose (valid/lawful)</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== TYPES OF TRUSTS ===== -->
    <h2 id="types">II. Types of Trusts</h2>

    <h3>A. Express Private Trusts</h3>
    <p>Created by the <strong>express intention</strong> of the settlor, either inter vivos or by will. These are the "classic" trusts tested on the bar and require all five elements above.</p>

    <h4>1. Inter Vivos Trusts (Living Trusts)</h4>
    <p>Created during the settlor's lifetime by:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Declaration of trust:</strong> Settlor declares themselves trustee of their own property.</li>
      <li><strong>Deed of trust / transfer in trust:</strong> Settlor transfers property to a third-party trustee.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An inter vivos trust of <strong>real property</strong> must generally satisfy the Statute of Frauds (writing requirement). An inter vivos trust of <strong>personal property</strong> may be created orally in most jurisdictions, though proof requirements apply.</p>

    <h4>2. Testamentary Trusts</h4>
    <p>Created by the settlor's <strong>will</strong>, taking effect at death. Must comply with all formalities of will execution (Wills Act formalities). The trust is subject to probate.</p>

    <h4>3. Pour-Over Wills</h4>
    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h3>Pour-Over Will Doctrine</h3>
      <p>A <strong>pour-over will</strong> devises assets from a probate estate into an existing inter vivos trust. Under the <strong>Uniform Testamentary Additions to Trusts Act (UTATA)</strong> and <strong>CA Prob. Code &sect; 6300</strong>, the pour-over gift is valid if the trust was <strong>executed before, concurrently with, or after</strong> the will, even if the trust is later amended. The trust need not have a corpus at the time the will is executed.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>4. Revocable vs. Irrevocable Trusts</h4>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>CA Distinction &mdash; Presumption of Revocability</h3>
      <p>Under the <strong>common law (majority rule)</strong>, a trust is <strong>irrevocable</strong> unless the settlor expressly reserves the power to revoke.</p>
      <p>Under <strong>California law</strong> (Prob. Code &sect; 15400) and the <strong>UTC</strong>, a trust is presumed <strong>revocable</strong> unless the trust instrument expressly provides that it is irrevocable. This is a critical CA distinction frequently tested on the bar.</p>
    </div>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Revocable Trust</th><th>Irrevocable Trust</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Settlor control</td><td>Settlor retains full power to revoke, amend, or direct</td><td>Settlor gives up control; cannot unilaterally revoke or amend</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Creditor access (during settlor's life)</td><td>Trust assets reachable by settlor's creditors</td><td>Generally shielded from settlor's creditors (unless fraudulent transfer)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Creditor access (after settlor's death)</td><td>CA: assets subject to creditor claims for debts of deceased settlor (Prob. Code &sect; 19001)</td><td>Not available to settlor's creditors post-death</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Tax treatment</td><td>Grantor trust &mdash; income taxed to settlor</td><td>May be separate tax entity</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Avoids probate?</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CA presumption</td><td>Default (Prob. Code &sect; 15400)</td><td>Must be expressly stated</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Method of revocation in CA</td><td>By any method provided in the trust, or by writing (other than a will) delivered to the trustee (Prob. Code &sect; 15401)</td><td>N/A &mdash; cannot be revoked</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>B. Charitable Trusts</h3>
    <p>A <strong>charitable trust</strong> is one created for charitable purposes. It differs from a private trust in several critical ways:</p>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Charitable purpose required:</strong> Relief of poverty, advancement of education, advancement of religion, promotion of health, governmental or municipal purposes, or other purposes beneficial to the community. The purpose must benefit the <em>public</em> or a sufficiently large segment thereof.</li>
      <li><strong>No ascertainable beneficiaries required:</strong> The beneficiaries may be indefinite ("the poor of Los Angeles").</li>
      <li><strong>No RAP:</strong> Charitable trusts may last in <strong>perpetuity</strong> &mdash; they are exempt from the Rule Against Perpetuities.</li>
      <li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Enforced by the <strong>Attorney General</strong>, not by individual beneficiaries (who have no standing unless they are specifically designated).</li>
      <li><strong>Cy pres doctrine:</strong> If the specific charitable purpose becomes impossible, impracticable, or illegal, a court may redirect the trust to a <strong>similar charitable purpose</strong> rather than allowing it to fail &mdash; <em>if</em> the settlor had a <strong>general charitable intent</strong>. If the settlor had only a specific intent, the trust fails and a resulting trust arises for the settlor or settlor's estate.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>CA Distinction &mdash; Cy Pres</h3>
      <p>California Prob. Code &sect; 15409 provides that there is a <strong>presumption of general charitable intent</strong> when applying cy pres &mdash; i.e., courts will presume the settlor would have wanted the trust property applied to a similar charitable purpose unless the trust instrument expressly provides otherwise. This makes cy pres easier to apply in California.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>C. Honorary Trusts (Pet Trusts)</h3>
    <p>An <strong>honorary trust</strong> is a trust for a non-charitable purpose that has no ascertainable human beneficiary &mdash; most commonly, a trust for the care of an animal or the maintenance of a grave.</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Common law:</strong> Not enforceable as a trust (no beneficiary with standing to enforce), but the "trustee" may carry out the purpose on their honor. If the trustee refuses, a resulting trust arises.</li>
      <li><strong>Modern law / UTC / California:</strong> <strong>Pet trusts</strong> are now enforceable by statute. CA Prob. Code &sect; 15212 authorizes trusts for the care of a designated domestic or pet animal. The trust terminates when the last surviving animal dies. A court may appoint a person to enforce the trust, and may reduce the amount if it substantially exceeds what is needed.</li>
      <li><strong>RAP:</strong> Under the common law, honorary trusts were limited to the RAP period (lives in being + 21 years, or in CA, 90 years). Under modern statutes, pet trusts last for the life of the animal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Resulting Trusts</h3>
    <p>A <strong>resulting trust</strong> is a trust <em>implied by law</em> based on the <strong>presumed intent</strong> of the parties. It arises by <strong>operation of law</strong>, not by the express terms of an instrument.</p>

    <h4>1. When Resulting Trusts Arise</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Failure of an express trust:</strong> If an express trust fails (e.g., beneficiary predeceases, trust purpose becomes impossible without general charitable intent, excess corpus after trust purpose is fulfilled), the property reverts to the settlor (or settlor's estate) on a resulting trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase-money resulting trust (PMRT):</strong> When one person pays the purchase price for property but title is taken in another person's name, a resulting trust arises in favor of the payor &mdash; the title holder is presumed to hold in trust for the payor. <strong>Exception:</strong> If the title holder is a <em>natural object of the payor's bounty</em> (spouse, child, close relative), a <strong>gift is presumed</strong> instead.</li>
      <li><strong>Semi-secret trust:</strong> When a will makes a gift to a person "as trustee" but does not name the beneficiary. At common law, a resulting trust arises in favor of the testator's heirs. (A <em>secret</em> trust &mdash; an outright gift with an oral agreement to hold in trust &mdash; may be enforced as a constructive trust.)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-warning">
      <h3>Exam Trap: Purchase-Money Resulting Trust</h3>
      <p>Do not confuse a PMRT with a constructive trust. A <strong>resulting trust</strong> arises from presumed intent (the payor presumably intended to retain beneficial interest). A <strong>constructive trust</strong> arises as an equitable remedy to prevent unjust enrichment or fraud. If the facts involve wrongful conduct, argue constructive trust. If the facts involve a simple payment/title mismatch, argue resulting trust.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>E. Constructive Trusts</h3>
    <p>A <strong>constructive trust</strong> is not a true trust at all &mdash; it is an <strong>equitable remedy</strong> imposed by a court to prevent unjust enrichment. The "trustee" has only one duty: to <strong>convey the property</strong> to the person who is rightfully entitled to it.</p>

    <h4>1. When Constructive Trusts Are Imposed</h4>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Fraud or undue influence:</strong> Property obtained by fraud, duress, or undue influence.</li>
      <li><strong>Breach of fiduciary duty:</strong> A fiduciary who profits from the relationship improperly.</li>
      <li><strong>Breach of a confidential relationship:</strong> Similar to fiduciary duty but broader.</li>
      <li><strong>Secret trusts:</strong> Where a will makes an absolute gift but the recipient orally promised to hold for another. Extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove the promise, and a constructive trust is imposed to prevent unjust enrichment.</li>
      <li><strong>Theft, conversion, or wrongful acquisition:</strong> Property wrongfully taken or obtained.</li>
      <li><strong>Homicide / slayer rule:</strong> A person who kills the decedent holds the inheritance on constructive trust for those who would have taken absent the killing.</li>
    </ul>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Resulting Trust</th><th>Constructive Trust</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Basis</td><td>Presumed intent of parties</td><td>Equity &mdash; prevent unjust enrichment</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wrongdoing required?</td><td>No</td><td>Typically yes (fraud, breach of duty, etc.)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>When it arises</td><td>Failure of express trust; PMRT</td><td>Fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, secret trusts, theft</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Effect</td><td>Property returns to settlor/payor</td><td>Property transferred to rightful owner</td></tr>

    <!-- ===== TRUSTEE ===== -->
    <h2 id="trustee">III. The Trustee</h2>

    <h3>A. Acceptance, Resignation, and Removal</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> May be express (written acceptance) or implied (exercising trust powers, taking possession of trust property). Mere silence or inaction does <em>not</em> constitute acceptance.</li>
      <li><strong>Resignation:</strong> A trustee may resign (a) as provided in the trust instrument, (b) with consent of all beneficiaries, or (c) with court approval. In California, a trustee may resign by giving written notice to the beneficiaries and any co-trustees (Prob. Code &sect; 15640).</li>
      <li><strong>Removal:</strong> A court may remove a trustee for cause: breach of trust, incapacity, unfitness, unwillingness to administer, persistent failure to administer effectively, substantial change of circumstances, or hostility among co-trustees. In CA, the court may also remove a trustee for excessive compensation or for failure to provide accountings. (Prob. Code &sect; 15642.)</li>
      <li><strong>Successor trustees:</strong> If a trustee vacates the position, a successor is appointed as specified in the trust instrument; if the instrument is silent, the court appoints one. A trust does not fail for lack of a trustee.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Co-Trustees</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Majority rule:</strong> Under the UTC and CA law, co-trustees who are unable to reach a unanimous decision may act by <strong>majority vote</strong> (Prob. Code &sect; 15620).</li>
      <li><strong>Liability:</strong> A co-trustee is liable for a breach by another co-trustee if the co-trustee: (a) participated in or approved the breach, (b) failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent the breach, or (c) improperly delegated trust administration.</li>
      <li><strong>Delegation among co-trustees:</strong> A co-trustee cannot delegate to another co-trustee the performance of a function that requires the exercise of <em>joint</em> judgment.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ===== TRUSTEE DUTIES ===== -->
    <h2 id="duties">IV. Trustee Duties</h2>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h3>Core Fiduciary Standard</h3>
      <p>A trustee is a <strong>fiduciary</strong> held to the highest standard of conduct. The trustee must administer the trust <strong>solely in the interests of the beneficiaries</strong> (the "sole interest" rule) and in accordance with the terms of the trust and applicable law.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>A. Duty of Loyalty</h3>
    <p>The most important and most tested trustee duty. The trustee must administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries and must not engage in <strong>self-dealing</strong>.</p>

    <div class="callout-warning">
      <h3>The "No Further Inquiry" Rule</h3>
      <p>Self-dealing transactions are <strong>voidable</strong> regardless of the trustee's good faith and regardless of whether the transaction was fair. The court will <em>not inquire</em> into the reasonableness of the transaction. This is the <strong>"no further inquiry" rule</strong> &mdash; once self-dealing is established, the transaction is voidable at the beneficiary's election, period.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Self-dealing</strong> includes:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Buying or selling trust assets to/from oneself.</li>
      <li>Borrowing trust funds or lending trust funds to oneself.</li>
      <li>Using trust property for personal purposes.</li>
      <li>Transactions between the trust and the trustee's spouse, business associates, or other entities in which the trustee has an interest.</li>
      <li>Corporate trustee buying its own stock with trust funds.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Exceptions</strong> to the self-dealing prohibition:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>The trust instrument <strong>expressly authorizes</strong> the transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Court approval</strong> is obtained in advance.</li>
      <li><strong>All beneficiaries</strong> (who have capacity) consent after full disclosure.</li>
      <li>The transaction involves a <strong>fair and reasonable</strong> benefit to the trust and is specifically approved by a disinterested party (e.g., co-trustee).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Duty of Prudence / Care</h3>
    <p>The trustee must administer the trust with the <strong>care, skill, and caution</strong> that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in managing their own affairs (or, for professional trustees, the care of a professional fiduciary).</p>

    <h3>C. Duty to Invest &mdash; Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA)</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h3>Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA) &mdash; Key Principles</h3>
      <p>California has adopted the UPIA (Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 16045&ndash;16054). The UPIA replaced the old "legal list" and "prudent man" standards. Key principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Portfolio standard:</strong> No investment is imprudent <em>per se</em>. Each investment is evaluated in the context of the <strong>total portfolio</strong>, not in isolation.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk/return:</strong> The trustee must consider the risk and return objectives of the trust as a whole.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> The trustee must <strong>diversify</strong> investments unless, under the circumstances, it is prudent not to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegation permitted:</strong> The trustee may delegate investment functions to agents, provided the trustee exercises reasonable care in selecting and supervising the agent.</li>
        <li><strong>Factors to consider:</strong> General economic conditions, inflation/deflation, tax consequences, the role of each investment in the overall portfolio, expected total return, beneficiaries' other resources, needs for liquidity, and the trust's special relationship to particular assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Inception assets:</strong> The trustee must review assets received at inception and make decisions about retention or disposition within a <strong>reasonable time</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>D. Duty to Diversify</h3>
    <p>Under the UPIA, the trustee has a <strong>specific duty to diversify</strong> trust investments within a reasonable time after accepting trusteeship, unless the trustee reasonably determines that, because of special circumstances, the purposes of the trust are better served without diversification. The duty to diversify is <em>separate</em> from the general duty to invest prudently.</p>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>CA Distinction &mdash; Inception Assets</h3>
      <p>In California, a trustee is not automatically liable for retaining assets received at inception (e.g., the settlor transferred a concentrated stock position), but the trustee must make an affirmative decision about retention within a reasonable time, considering the UPIA factors. Failure to review inception assets is itself a breach.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>E. Duty to Inform and Account</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>The trustee must keep beneficiaries <strong>reasonably informed</strong> about the trust and its administration.</li>
      <li>The trustee must provide <strong>accountings</strong> at least annually and upon reasonable request.</li>
      <li>In CA (Prob. Code &sect; 16061.7), the trustee must provide notice to beneficiaries and heirs when a <strong>revocable trust becomes irrevocable</strong> (typically upon the settlor's death) within 60 days. This triggers the <strong>120-day contest period</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>F. Duty of Impartiality</h3>
    <p>When a trust has <strong>multiple beneficiaries</strong> (e.g., income beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries), the trustee must act <strong>impartially</strong>, balancing the interests of all beneficiaries. The trustee cannot favor one beneficiary at the expense of another, unless the trust instrument directs otherwise.</p>
    <p>This duty is central to trust accounting &mdash; decisions about what constitutes "income" versus "principal" directly affect different classes of beneficiaries.</p>

    <h3>G. Duty Not to Delegate Improperly</h3>
    <p>Under the traditional rule, a trustee could not delegate duties that required the exercise of discretion or judgment ("delegatus non potest delegare"). Under the <strong>modern/UPIA rule</strong>, a trustee <em>may</em> delegate investment and management functions, but must:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li>Exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution in <strong>selecting</strong> the agent.</li>
      <li>Establish the <strong>scope and terms</strong> of the delegation consistent with the trust's purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitor</strong> the agent's performance and compliance periodically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>H. Duty to Earmark</h3>
    <p>Trust property must be <strong>labeled or designated as trust property</strong> (e.g., "John Smith, Trustee of the Smith Family Trust"). Failure to earmark can result in liability if a loss occurs that would not have occurred had the property been properly earmarked. Under modern law, liability attaches only if the failure to earmark <em>caused</em> the loss.</p>

    <h3>I. Duty to Segregate (Not Commingle)</h3>
    <p>The trustee must keep trust property <strong>separate from the trustee's own property</strong> and from other trusts. Commingling is a breach of trust even if no loss results.</p>

    <h2 id="powers">V. Trustee Powers</h2>

    <p>Trustee powers come from three sources:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Express powers:</strong> Granted by the trust instrument. These are primary and should be the first place to look.</li>
      <li><strong>Implied powers:</strong> Powers reasonably necessary to carry out the trust's purposes and to administer the trust effectively, even if not expressly stated (e.g., the power to sell trust property, incur expenses, hire agents).</li>
      <li><strong>Court-granted powers:</strong> A court may grant additional powers if needed to achieve the trust's purposes or to respond to circumstances not anticipated by the settlor.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>CA Distinction &mdash; Broad Statutory Powers</h3>
      <p>CA Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 16200&ndash;16249 grants trustees an extensive list of default powers (sell, lease, borrow, invest, allocate receipts, etc.) unless the trust instrument limits them. This means CA trustees have <strong>broad implied statutory powers</strong> even without express language.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ===== BENEFICIARIES ===== -->
    <h2 id="beneficiaries">VI. Beneficiaries and Beneficial Interests</h2>

    <h3>A. Spendthrift Trusts</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h3>Spendthrift Clause</h3>
      <p>A <strong>spendthrift provision</strong> restrains both <strong>voluntary alienation</strong> (the beneficiary cannot transfer their interest) and <strong>involuntary alienation</strong> (creditors cannot reach the beneficiary's interest in the trust) &mdash; while the interest remains in the trust. Once trust funds are <strong>distributed</strong> to the beneficiary, the spendthrift protection ends and creditors may reach those funds.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Validity:</strong> Spendthrift provisions are valid in virtually all U.S. jurisdictions, including California (Prob. Code &sect; 15300).</p>

    <p><strong>Exceptions &mdash; Creditors who CAN reach spendthrift trust interests:</strong></p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Child support and spousal support (alimony):</strong> The most commonly tested exception. A court may order the trustee to satisfy a support judgment from the beneficiary's trust interest (Prob. Code &sect; 15305).</li>
      <li><strong>Tax claims:</strong> Federal and state tax liens can attach to trust interests despite a spendthrift clause.</li>
      <li><strong>Providers of necessaries:</strong> In some jurisdictions (including CA), creditors who provided <em>necessaries of life</em> to the beneficiary may reach the trust interest (Prob. Code &sect; 15307).</li>
      <li><strong>Self-settled spendthrift trusts:</strong> A settlor who creates a trust for their <em>own</em> benefit cannot use a spendthrift clause to shield assets from their own creditors. The creditors of the settlor-beneficiary may reach the trust assets to the maximum extent the trustee could distribute to the settlor. (Prob. Code &sect; 15304.) This is a <strong>major exam point</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Tort judgments:</strong> In California, the court has discretion to allow a tort judgment creditor to reach the beneficiary's interest (Prob. Code &sect; 15306.5 &mdash; enacted 2016).</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-warning">
      <h3>Exam Trap: Self-Settled Trusts</h3>
      <p>If the settlor creates a trust for their <em>own</em> benefit with a spendthrift clause, that clause is <strong>void as to the settlor's creditors</strong>. This is true even if the trust also has other beneficiaries. The creditors can reach any amount the trustee <em>could</em> distribute to the settlor (including the entire corpus if distribution is discretionary). Watch for this whenever the settlor names themselves as a beneficiary.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>B. Discretionary Trusts</h3>
    <p>In a <strong>discretionary trust</strong>, the trustee has discretion over whether and how much to distribute to the beneficiary. The beneficiary has no enforceable right to any specific distribution.</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Creditor access:</strong> Creditors generally <em>cannot</em> compel distributions from a discretionary trust. They may be able to reach distributions once they are made.</li>
      <li><strong>Trustee's discretion:</strong> Even with discretionary authority, the trustee must exercise discretion in <strong>good faith</strong> and in accordance with the trust's terms and purposes. A trustee who exercises no judgment at all, or acts in bad faith, may be compelled by a court to act.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard of review:</strong> Courts review trustee discretion for abuse &mdash; not whether the court would have made a different decision, but whether the trustee acted reasonably within the bounds of the granted discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Support Trusts</h3>
    <p>A <strong>support trust</strong> directs the trustee to distribute income or principal as necessary for the beneficiary's <strong>support, health, education, and maintenance</strong>. The beneficiary is entitled to distributions necessary for support.</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Creditor access:</strong> Creditors who provided <em>necessaries</em> may reach the beneficiary's interest (because such claims align with the trust's purpose).</li>
      <li><strong>Voluntary alienation:</strong> The beneficiary cannot voluntarily assign their interest beyond what is needed for support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A. Revocation / Modification by Settlor</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Revocable trust:</strong> The settlor may revoke or modify at any time, in any manner specified in the trust instrument or, in CA, by a writing (other than a will) delivered to the trustee (Prob. Code &sect; 15401).</li>
      <li><strong>Irrevocable trust:</strong> The settlor generally <em>cannot</em> revoke unilaterally. However, if <strong>all beneficiaries</strong> consent, the settlor and beneficiaries together may modify or terminate even an irrevocable trust.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>CA Distinction &mdash; Revocation Method</h3>
      <p>Under CA Prob. Code &sect; 15401(a)(2), if the trust instrument does not specify a method of revocation, the settlor may revoke by a <strong>writing (other than a will) delivered to the trustee</strong> during the settlor's lifetime. A will alone is <em>not</em> sufficient to revoke an inter vivos trust (even though it may attempt to do so). Note: Some older CA cases allowed other methods, but the statutory method is the tested rule.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>B. Termination by Beneficiaries &mdash; The Claflin Doctrine</h3>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h3>Claflin Doctrine (Common Law / Majority Rule)</h3>
      <p>Under the <strong>Claflin doctrine</strong> (from <em>Claflin v. Claflin</em>, 1889), beneficiaries may <em>not</em> compel termination of a trust, even if they <strong>all consent</strong>, if termination would be inconsistent with a <strong>material purpose</strong> of the trust. Common material purposes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spendthrift protection</li>
        <li>Staged distributions (e.g., age conditions)</li>
        <li>Support trusts</li>
        <li>Discretionary trusts</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>If no material purpose is frustrated:</strong> All beneficiaries (including remainder beneficiaries), if they all have capacity and all consent, may terminate the trust even over the trustee's objection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>CA Distinction &mdash; Modification by Beneficiaries</h3>
      <p>Under CA Prob. Code &sect; 15403, if <strong>all beneficiaries consent</strong>, they may compel modification or termination of a trust even if it is <strong>inconsistent with a material purpose</strong> of the trust &mdash; but only if the court determines that the reason for the modification or termination <strong>outweighs</strong> the material purpose. This is more liberal than the strict Claflin rule.</p>
      <p>Under &sect; 15404, if <strong>not all beneficiaries consent</strong>, the court may still modify or terminate if the interests of non-consenting beneficiaries are adequately protected.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>C. Court-Ordered Modification or Termination</h3>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Changed circumstances:</strong> A court may modify or terminate a trust if, due to circumstances <strong>not anticipated by the settlor</strong>, modification or termination would further the trust's purposes (UTC &sect; 412; CA Prob. Code &sect; 15409.5).</li>
      <li><strong>Uneconomic trust:</strong> A court may terminate a trust if it has become <strong>uneconomic to administer</strong> (the value of the corpus is insufficient to justify the costs of administration). (UTC &sect; 414; CA Prob. Code &sect; 15408(b) &mdash; generally trusts with less than $50,000 in corpus.)</li>
      <li><strong>Merger (doctrine of merger):</strong> If the sole trustee becomes the sole beneficiary (legal and equitable title merge in one person), the trust terminates by operation of law.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose fulfilled or becomes impossible:</strong> A trust terminates when its purpose has been fully accomplished or becomes impossible or illegal.</li>
      <li><strong>By its own terms:</strong> A trust terminates according to its terms (e.g., "the trust shall terminate when my youngest child reaches age 30").</li>

    <!-- ===== RAP ===== -->
    <h2 id="rap">VIII. Rule Against Perpetuities and Trusts</h2>

    <div class="callout-rule">
      <h3>RAP and Trust Interests</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP)</strong> applies to future interests created in trust beneficiaries. Under the common law RAP, a future interest must <strong>vest or fail</strong> within a life in being plus 21 years, or the interest is void ab initio.</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Private trust interests:</strong> Subject to RAP. An interest granted to a beneficiary that might not vest within the perpetuities period is void.</li>
      <li><strong>Charitable trusts:</strong> <strong>Exempt</strong> from RAP &mdash; may last in perpetuity.</li>
      <li><strong>Shift from charity to charity:</strong> Also exempt from RAP.</li>
      <li><strong>Shift from private to charitable (or vice versa):</strong> Subject to RAP.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP) / CA Rule</h3>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>CA Distinction &mdash; 90-Year Vesting Period</h3>
      <p>California has adopted the <strong>Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP)</strong> with a <strong>90-year vesting period</strong> (Prob. Code &sect; 21205). Under USRAP, a nonvested property interest is valid if it either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Satisfies the <strong>common law RAP</strong> (lives in being + 21 years), <em>or</em></li>
        <li><strong>Actually vests or terminates</strong> within <strong>90 years</strong> of its creation (the "wait and see" alternative).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is more forgiving than the common law RAP. On the exam, apply the common law rule first; if the interest fails, check whether it would be saved under the 90-year USRAP rule.</p>

    <!-- ===== TRUST ACCOUNTING ===== -->
    <h2 id="accounting">IX. Trust Accounting: Income vs. Principal</h2>

    <p>Trust accounting rules govern the allocation of receipts and disbursements between <strong>income</strong> and <strong>principal</strong>. This is crucial when a trust has both <strong>income beneficiaries</strong> (e.g., life tenant) and <strong>remainder beneficiaries</strong>.</p>

    <table class="comparison-table">

    <h3>UPIA Power to Adjust</h3>
    <p>Under the <strong>Uniform Principal and Income Act (UPAIA)</strong>, adopted in CA, a trustee may <strong>reallocate</strong> receipts between income and principal (the "power to adjust") if the trustee determines that the traditional allocation would be unfair to either class of beneficiary, given the investment strategy adopted under the UPIA. This allows the trustee to invest for total return while maintaining impartiality between income and remainder beneficiaries.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Example: Power to Adjust</strong></summary>
      <p>Suppose a trust invests entirely in growth stocks (producing little dividend income but high capital appreciation). The income beneficiary receives almost nothing, while the remainder beneficiary benefits greatly. The trustee may use the <strong>power to adjust</strong> to reallocate some capital gains as "income" to ensure the income beneficiary receives a fair share of the total return.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- ===== REMEDIES ===== -->
    <h2 id="remedies">X. Remedies for Breach of Trust</h2>

    <p>When a trustee breaches a fiduciary duty, beneficiaries have several remedies available:</p>

    <h3>A. Money Damages (Surcharge)</h3>
    <p>The trustee may be <strong>surcharged</strong> (held personally liable) for:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Losses</strong> to the trust caused by the breach.</li>
      <li><strong>Profits</strong> the trustee made from the breach (disgorgement).</li>
      <li><strong>Profits</strong> the trust <em>would have earned</em> absent the breach (lost opportunity).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The beneficiary need not prove all three &mdash; the remedy is whichever measure puts the trust in the position it would have been in absent the breach.</p>

    <h3>B. Constructive Trust</h3>
    <p>If the trustee improperly transfers trust property to a third party or uses trust funds to acquire property, the beneficiary may seek a <strong>constructive trust</strong> over that property. This gives the beneficiary a <strong>priority claim</strong> (superior to general creditors).</p>

    <h3>C. Tracing</h3>
    <p>If trust property has been wrongfully commingled with the trustee's personal funds, the beneficiary may <strong>trace</strong> the trust property into its product and impose an equitable lien or constructive trust. Common tracing rules:</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>Lowest intermediate balance rule:</strong> When commingled funds are in a bank account, the trust is deemed to own the <em>lowest balance</em> the account reached after commingling (any withdrawal below the trust amount is a dissipation of trust funds).</li>
      <li><strong>Presumptions favor the trust:</strong> Withdrawals from commingled accounts are presumed to come from the trustee's personal funds first (protecting the trust), unless the trustee's intent or the facts show otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Removal of Trustee</h3>
    <p>A court may <strong>remove</strong> the breaching trustee and appoint a successor, with or without additional monetary relief.</p>

    <h3>E. Equitable Lien</h3>
    <p>The beneficiary may impose an <strong>equitable lien</strong> on property acquired with trust funds. This secures the beneficiary's claim against the property, particularly useful if the property has decreased in value (the beneficiary is a secured creditor).</p>

    <h3>F. Injunction and Other Equitable Relief</h3>
    <p>A court may <strong>enjoin</strong> a threatened breach or order specific performance of trust obligations.</p>

    <details>
      <summary><strong>Choosing the Right Remedy on the Exam</strong></summary>
      <ul>
        <li>If the breach resulted in a <strong>loss</strong>: Surcharge for the amount of the loss.</li>
        <li>If the trustee <strong>profited</strong>: Surcharge for the profits (disgorgement) or constructive trust on profits/property acquired.</li>
        <li>If trust property was <strong>transferred</strong> to a BFP: Surcharge (cannot recover from BFP).</li>
        <li>If trust property was <strong>commingled</strong>: Tracing + constructive trust or equitable lien on the product.</li>
        <li>If the property value <strong>went up</strong>: Constructive trust (beneficiary gets the appreciated property).</li>
        <li>If the property value <strong>went down</strong>: Equitable lien (beneficiary gets a secured claim for original value).</li>

    <h3>A. Probate Code Trust Provisions</h3>
    <p>California's trust law is codified in <strong>Prob. Code &sect;&sect; 15000&ndash;18201</strong>. Key CA-specific provisions to know:</p>

    <div class="callout-california">
      <h3>Summary of Key CA Trust Rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Presumption of revocability:</strong> Trusts are revocable unless expressly stated otherwise (&sect; 15400).</li>
        <li><strong>Revocation method:</strong> Writing delivered to trustee (&sect; 15401).</li>
        <li><strong>Creditors of revocable trusts:</strong> Trust property of a revocable trust is subject to the settlor's creditors during the settlor's lifetime and, after death, to claims of the deceased settlor's creditors (&sect; 19001).</li>
        <li><strong>Notification requirement:</strong> Trustee must notify beneficiaries and heirs within 60 days of the settlor's death (&sect; 16061.7), triggering a 120-day contest period (&sect; 16061.8).</li>
        <li><strong>Pet trusts:</strong> Enforceable (&sect; 15212).</li>
        <li><strong>Cy pres:</strong> Presumption of general charitable intent (&sect; 15409).</li>
        <li><strong>Modification even over material purpose:</strong> Possible with all beneficiaries' consent if reasons outweigh the material purpose (&sect; 15403).</li>
        <li><strong>90-year RAP (USRAP):</strong> &sect; 21205.</li>
        <li><strong>Broad statutory trustee powers:</strong> &sect;&sect; 16200&ndash;16249.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>B. No-Contest Clauses</h3>
    <p>A <strong>no-contest clause</strong> (in terrorem clause) in a trust instrument provides that a beneficiary who contests the trust forfeits their interest.</p>
    <ul class="elements-list">
      <li><strong>CA rule (Prob. Code &sect; 21311):</strong> A no-contest clause is <strong>enforceable</strong>, but <em>only</em> against <strong>direct contests</strong> brought without <strong>probable cause</strong>.</li>
      <li>A <strong>direct contest</strong> is a contest that alleges invalidity of the instrument or one or more of its terms based on forgery, lack of due execution, lack of capacity, menace/duress/fraud/undue influence, revocation, or disqualification of a beneficiary under &sect; 6112.</li>
      <li>A contest filed with <strong>probable cause</strong> (objectively reasonable basis) does <strong>not</strong> trigger forfeiture, even if the contest ultimately fails.</li>
      <li><strong>Creditor claims</strong>, requests for accountings, and petitions related to trust administration are generally <strong>not</strong> "contests" that trigger a no-contest clause.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Trust Protectors</h3>
    <p>California law permits the use of a <strong>trust protector</strong> &mdash; a person designated in the trust instrument to exercise certain powers such as modifying the trust, removing or replacing the trustee, or approving trustee actions. (Prob. Code &sect; 16002(c).) Trust protectors are fiduciaries and are subject to oversight by the court.</p>

    <h3>D. Pour-Over Wills in CA</h3>
    <p>Under CA Prob. Code &sect; 6300, a will may pour assets into a trust even if the trust is <strong>amendable or revocable</strong> and even if the trust is <strong>amended after the will is executed</strong>. The trust need not have been funded during the testator's lifetime. This eliminates many common-law problems with pour-over gifts.</p>

      <li><strong>Trust creation:</strong> Is there a valid trust? Check all five elements (STBIP). Watch for precatory language, missing res, or indefinite beneficiaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Type of trust:</strong> Express private, charitable, resulting, or constructive? Inter vivos or testamentary? Revocable or irrevocable?</li>
      <li><strong>Pour-over will:</strong> Does the will pour into a trust? Was the trust in existence? CA allows pour-over even to an unfunded, amendable trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Trustee duties:</strong> Loyalty (self-dealing, no further inquiry), prudence, UPIA (diversification, portfolio standard), impartiality, inform/account, segregate, earmark.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-dealing:</strong> Any transaction between the trustee and the trust? Apply the no further inquiry rule. Check for exceptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment:</strong> Has the trustee invested prudently under the UPIA? Reviewed inception assets? Diversified?</li>
      <li><strong>Spendthrift:</strong> Is there a spendthrift clause? What type of creditor? Is the trust self-settled?</li>
      <li><strong>Discretionary / support trust:</strong> What standard governs distributions? Can a creditor compel distribution?</li>
      <li><strong>Modification / termination:</strong> Can the settlor revoke? Do all beneficiaries consent? Is there a material purpose? CA &sect; 15403 balancing test? Changed circumstances? Uneconomic?</li>
      <li><strong>RAP:</strong> Do any beneficial interests violate the RAP? Apply CA 90-year USRAP if the common-law rule voids the interest.</li>
      <li><strong>Charitable trust:</strong> Valid charitable purpose? Cy pres applicable? AG enforcement?</li>
      <li><strong>Resulting trust:</strong> Did an express trust fail? Purchase-money situation?</li>
      <li><strong>Constructive trust:</strong> Fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, secret trust, slayer rule?</li>
      <li><strong>Remedies for breach:</strong> Surcharge, constructive trust, tracing, equitable lien, removal, injunction.</li>
      <li><strong>No-contest clause:</strong> Is there one? Is the contest "direct"? Does the contestant have probable cause? (CA rule.)</li>
      <li><strong>Notification:</strong> In CA, did the trustee notify beneficiaries within 60 days of settlor's death?</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Trusts Exam Strategy</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Always start with trust creation.</strong> Before analyzing duties or modification, confirm that a valid trust exists. Walk through every element, even briefly.</li>
        <li><strong>State the general rule, then the CA rule.</strong> On the CA bar, you get points for both. For example: "Under the common law, trusts are presumed irrevocable. However, under California Probate Code section 15400, trusts are presumed revocable."</li>
        <li><strong>Loyalty is king.</strong> The duty of loyalty and the no further inquiry rule are the most commonly tested trustee duties. Whenever a trustee does <em>anything</em> that benefits themselves, flag it immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Know the spendthrift exceptions cold.</strong> Child support, tax, necessaries, self-settled trusts, and (in CA) tort judgments.</li>
        <li><strong>Distinguish resulting and constructive trusts.</strong> Resulting = presumed intent, no wrongdoing. Constructive = equitable remedy, wrongdoing or unjust enrichment.</li>
        <li><strong>Remedies matter.</strong> Don't just identify the breach &mdash; tell the grader what relief is available and which remedy best serves the beneficiary.</li>
        <li><strong>Crossover with wills:</strong> Trusts frequently appear with wills questions. Be ready to discuss testamentary trusts, pour-over wills, and the interplay between probate assets and trust assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Crossover with community property:</strong> When a spouse places community property in a trust, CP rules may affect the trust (e.g., the non-settlor spouse's interest in community property in a revocable trust).</li>
        <li><strong>Watch for capacity issues:</strong> If the fact pattern mentions an elderly settlor, mental decline, or undue influence, raise testamentary/contractual capacity and potential constructive trust.</li>
        <li><strong>UPIA details:</strong> Know that no investment is imprudent per se, the portfolio standard applies, diversification is required, and delegation is permitted with proper care.</li>
      </ol>
